The provided NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several feature values that deviate from normal network activity. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious indicators:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.216.24.42) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for being part of a DDoS botnet. This suggests that the traffic may be related to malicious activities.

2. **Protocol**: The protocol used is TCP (protocol 6), which is a common protocol for many internet applications. However, when combined with other features, it raises suspicions.

3. **L7 Protocol**: The L7 protocol (7.0) corresponds to HTTP, which is a common protocol for web traffic. While not inherently malicious, it's unusual in this context given the source IP and other features.

4. **TCP Flags**: The TCP flags (219) indicate an unusual combination of flags, which may be indicative of scanning or malicious activities.

5. **Flow Duration**: The flow duration (4294964 milliseconds) is unusually long, suggesting a persistent connection that deviates from normal session durations.

6. **Inbound and Outbound Bytes**: The inbound bytes (524) and outbound bytes (1147) are relatively low, but the ratio of outbound to inbound bytes is unusual, indicating potential data exfiltration attempts.

7. **Packet Size Distribution**: The distribution of packet sizes is unusual, with a longest flow packet of 975 bytes and a shortest flow packet of 40 bytes. This may indicate anomalous packet size distributions.

8. **Throughput**: The average throughput (1392000 bps for src to dst and 3056000 bps for dst to src) is unusually high, which may indicate data exfiltration or other malicious activities.

Considering these feature values, the Network Intrusion Detection System has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to its unusual characteristics, which may be indicative of a DDoS botnet or data exfiltration attempts.
