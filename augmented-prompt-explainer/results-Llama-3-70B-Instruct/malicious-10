The provided NetFlow data has been flagged as malicious due to several features that deviate from normal network activity. Here's a detailed explanation of why it's considered malicious:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.219.9.1) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for IP flagged in multiple attack patterns. This suggests that the source IP is potentially compromised or associated with malicious activities.

2. **Destination IP**: The destination IP address (172.31.69.28) is an internal IP address, which may indicate data exfiltration attempts or unauthorized access to the internal network.

3. **Protocol and Port**: The protocol used is TCP (protocol 6), and the destination port is 80, which is commonly associated with HTTP traffic. However, the source port (50153) is non-standard and may indicate an attempt to bypass firewall rules or evade detection.

4. **TCP Flags**: The cumulative TCP flags (219) and client TCP flags (219) are unusual and may indicate a scanning activity or an attempt to establish a connection using non-standard flags.

5. **Flow Duration**: The flow duration is 4294959 milliseconds, which is approximately 71 minutes. This is an unusually long connection duration, potentially indicating a persistent connection that deviates from normal session durations.

6. **Packet Size**: The longest packet size (975 bytes) and shortest packet size (40 bytes) indicate deviations in average packet size, which may be indicative of anomalous packet sizes.

7. **Throughput**: The source-to-destination average throughput (464000 bps) and destination-to-source average throughput (1144000 bps) are unusually high, potentially indicating a large volume of data being transferred.

8. **Packet Distribution**: The distribution of packets by size (NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 8, NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES: 0, etc.) suggests an unusual pattern of packet sizes, which may be indicative of scanning or malicious activities.

Considering these features, the NetFlow data is considered malicious due to its association with known malicious IP addresses, non-standard protocol and port usage, unusual TCP flags, long connection duration, anomalous packet sizes, high throughput, and unusual packet distribution.
