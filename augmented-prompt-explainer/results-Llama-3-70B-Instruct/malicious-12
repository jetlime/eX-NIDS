The Network Intrusion Detection System has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to several indicators that suggest suspicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.219.193.20) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for SSH brute-force activity observed in the past. This raises concerns about the legitimacy of the traffic.
2. **Protocol**: The protocol used is TCP (protocol 6), which is a common protocol, but the combination with the L7 protocol (HTTP, numeric value 7) suggests that this traffic may be related to Web-based activities.
3. **Destination IP**: The destination IP address (172.31.69.25) is an internal IP address, which implies that the traffic is attempting to access a system within the network.

Malicious indicators:

1. **High TCP flags value**: The TCP flags value of 27 indicates an unusual combination of flags, which may be indicative of scanning or other malicious activities.
2. **Retransmitted packets**: There are retransmitted packets (RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 431 and RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1), which could indicate failed connection attempts or brute-force attacks.
3. **Unusual packet sizes**: The longest flow packet size is 987 bytes, while the shortest flow packet size is 52 bytes. This deviation in average packet size may be an anomaly.
4. **High throughput**: The source-to-destination average throughput (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 104000) and destination-to-source average throughput (DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 184000) are unusually high, which could indicate data exfiltration attempts.

Given these feature values, the Network Intrusion Detection System has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to the combination of suspicious indicators, including the source IP address with a history of SSH brute-force activity, unusual protocol and packet characteristics, and high throughput.
