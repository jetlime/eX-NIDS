The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several feature values that deviate from normal network activity. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious features:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.218.115.60) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for sending spam emails. This raises concerns about the legitimacy of the traffic.
2. **Destination IP**: The destination IP address (172.31.69.28) is an internal IP address, which is unusual for external communications. This could indicate a potential data exfiltration attempt or unauthorized access to an internal system.
3. **Protocol and Port**: The protocol used is TCP (IP Layer 6), and the destination port is 80, which is commonly associated with HTTP traffic. However, the source port (54611) is non-standard and may indicate an attempt to bypass firewall rules or evade detection.
4. **TCP Flags**: The cumulative TCP flags (219) and client TCP flags (219) are unusual and may indicate a scanning or malicious activity. The server TCP flags (27) are also suspiciously low.
5. **Flow Duration**: The flow duration is relatively long (4294935 milliseconds), which could indicate a persistent connection, potentially allowing an attacker to maintain access to the system.
6. **Packet Size**: The longest packet size (975 bytes) and shortest packet size (40 bytes) deviate from normal HTTP traffic, which typically has smaller packet sizes.
7. **Throughput**: The average throughput (128000 bps for src-to-dst and 272000 bps for dst-to-src) is higher than usual for HTTP traffic, indicating a potential data exfiltration attempt.

Considering these features, the NetFlow data is likely malicious due to the unusual protocol and port usage, suspicious TCP flags, and anomalous packet sizes. The long flow duration and high throughput also suggest that the connection may be attempting to transfer large amounts of data, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or other malicious activities.
