The provided NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several feature values that deviate from normal network activity. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Unexpected Protocol**: The L7_PROTO value of 0.0 indicates an unknown protocol, which is unusual and may indicate a custom or malicious application.
2. **Uncommon Port**: The destination port 53 is unusual for UDP traffic (PROTOCOL: 17). Port 53 is typically used for DNS, but it's not common to see it as the destination port in internal network communication.
3. **Anomalous Packet Size**: The LONGEST_FLOW_PKT and SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT values are 85 and 69 bytes, respectively, which is smaller than typical packet sizes. This could indicate an attempt to evade detection or communicate with a malicious server.
4. **High Throughput**: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT values are 1104000 and 1016000 bps, respectively, which is unusually high for internal network communication.
5. **Unusual Traffic Pattern**: The IN_BYTES and OUT_BYTES values are 69 and 85 bytes, respectively, with only one packet in each direction (IN_PKTS and OUT_PKTS). This suggests an unusual traffic pattern that may be indicative of a malicious activity.

While there is no single feature value that screams "malicious," the combination of these unusual characteristics raises suspicions. The unknown protocol, uncommon port, anomalous packet size, high throughput, and unusual traffic pattern all contribute to the flagging of this NetFlow data as malicious.

It's essential to further investigate this traffic to determine if it's a legitimate activity or a potential security threat.
