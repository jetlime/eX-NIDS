The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several indicators that suggest unusual and potentially malicious activity. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.216.200.189) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, which has been known for IP flagged for SSH brute-force attempts. This suggests that the source IP may be associated with malicious activity.

2. **Low Traffic Volume**: The IN_BYTES (232) and OUT_BYTES (1136) values are relatively low compared to normal network traffic. This could indicate a stealthy, low-and-slow attack attempting to avoid detection.

3. **Unexpected Protocol**: The L7_PROTO value of 7.0 corresponds to the HTTP protocol, which is unusual for an internal IP address (172.31.69.25). This may indicate Command and Control (C&C) traffic or data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Anomalous Packet Size**: The LONGEST_FLOW_PKT value of 1004 bytes is unusually large compared to the average packet size, which may indicate data exfiltration or other malicious activities.

5. **Unusual TCP Flags**: The TCP_FLAGS value of 223 and CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS value of 222 are unusual combinations that may indicate scanning or other malicious activities.

6. **High Number of Failed Connections**: Although not explicitly shown in this NetFlow sample, the source IP address has been known for SSH brute-force attempts, which suggests a high number of failed connection attempts.

7. **Large Outbound Data Transfers**: The OUT_BYTES value of 1136 is relatively large compared to the IN_BYTES value, indicating an unusually large volume of outbound data, which may be indicative of data exfiltration attempts.

8. **Persistent Connections**: Although not explicitly shown in this NetFlow sample, the flow duration of 0 milliseconds suggests a persistent connection that deviates from normal session durations, potentially indicating an attacker maintaining access to a system.

Considering these indicators, it is likely that the NetFlow data represents malicious activity, such as data exfiltration or Command and Control (C&C) traffic.
