The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to the following features:

1. **Unexpected Protocol**: The L7 protocol (Application protocol) is 0, which corresponds to an Unknown protocol. This is unusual and may indicate a custom or proprietary protocol being used for malicious purposes.
2. **Uncommon Port Number**: The destination port number (L4_DST_PORT) is 53, which is not a commonly used port number for UDP traffic. This could be an indication of port scanning or an attempt to communicate with a specific service on the destination host.
3. **Small Packet Size**: The packet sizes are unusually small, with IN_PKTS and OUT_PKTS both being 1, and MIN_IP_PKT_LEN and MAX_IP_PKT_LEN being 73 and 89 bytes respectively. This could be an indication of a reconnaissance or scanning activity.
4. **High Throughput**: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT values are unusually high (584000 and 712000 bps respectively), which may indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a malicious data transfer.

The combination of these features, particularly the unexpected protocol and small packet size, suggests that this NetFlow data may be related to malicious activity, such as reconnaissance or data exfiltration.
