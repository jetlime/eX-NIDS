The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several indicators that suggest anomalous behavior. Here's a breakdown of the features that led to this conclusion:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.219.9.1) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for being flagged in multiple attack patterns. This suggests that the source IP may be associated with malicious activities.

2. **Protocol**: The protocol used is TCP (protocol 6), which is a common protocol for many internet applications. However, the combination of TCP with an L7 protocol of 7.0 (HTTP) suggests that the traffic may be related to web-based activities.

3. **Destination IP**: The destination IP address (172.31.69.28) is an internal IP address, which may indicate that the malicious activity is targeting a specific system or network within the organization.

4. **TCP Flags**: The TCP flags value of 219 suggests unusual combinations of flags, which may be indicative of scanning or other malicious activities.

5. **Flow Duration**: The flow duration of 4294957 milliseconds (approximately 71 minutes) is unusually long, suggesting that the connection has been maintained for an extended period, potentially indicating an attacker maintaining access to a system.

6. **Packet Size Distribution**: The packet size distribution shows a mix of small and large packets, with a longest packet of 975 bytes and a shortest packet of 40 bytes. This variation in packet sizes may indicate attempts to evade detection or exploit vulnerabilities.

7. **Throughput**: The average throughput values (368000 and 912000) suggest that the traffic is generating a significant amount of data, which may be indicative of data exfiltration or other malicious activities.

8. **Packet Distribution**: The packet distribution shows a high number of packets up to 128 bytes (8 packets), with fewer packets in other size ranges. This distribution may indicate an attempt to send small amounts of data, potentially evading detection.

Considering these features, the NetFlow data is considered malicious due to the combination of:

* A suspicious source IP address
* Unusual protocol and packet size distributions
* Long flow duration and high throughput values
* An internal destination IP address

These indicators suggest that the traffic may be related to malicious activities such as data exfiltration, command and control (C&C) traffic, or other types of attacks. Further investigation is recommended to determine the nature and scope of the malicious activity.
