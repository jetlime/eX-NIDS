The provided NetFlow data has been flagged as malicious by the Network Intrusion Detection System. Upon analyzing the feature values present in the NetFlow sample, I have identified several indicators that suggest this traffic is malicious.

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.217.165.70) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for flagged suspicious DNS requests. This raises concerns about the legitimacy of the traffic.
2. **Protocol**: The protocol used is TCP (protocol 6), which is a common protocol for web traffic. However, the Layer 7 protocol (L7_PROTO) is identified as 7.0, which corresponds to HTTP. This suggests that the traffic is attempting to communicate with an internal IP address using HTTP.
3. **Destination IP**: The destination IP address (172.31.69.25) is an internal IP address, which is unusual for external communication. This could indicate an attempt to access a internal system or service from outside the network.
4. **TCP Flags**: The TCP flags (30) and client/server TCP flags (26/22) suggest that the connection is attempting to establish a persistent connection. This, combined with the short flow duration (0 milliseconds), may indicate a scanning or probing activity.
5. **Retransmitted packets**: There are 10 retransmitted in-packets (RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS) and 2820 retransmitted in-bytes (RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES). This could be an indication of a brute-force attack or reconnaissance activity.
6. **Packet size distribution**: The packet size distribution is unusual, with a longest flow packet of 282 bytes and a shortest flow packet of 40 bytes. This deviation from normal packet sizes may indicate an attempt to evade detection or exploit a vulnerability.
7. **Throughput**: The average throughput (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT) is unusually high at 26128000 bps, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or other malicious activity.

Considering these indicators, I conclude that this NetFlow data is likely malicious and may be related to a scanning, probing, or exploitation attempt. The unusual packet sizes, retransmitted packets, and high throughput suggest that the traffic is attempting to evade detection while maintaining a persistent connection with an internal system.
