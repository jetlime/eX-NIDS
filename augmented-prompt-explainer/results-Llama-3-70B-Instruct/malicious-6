The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several feature values that deviate from normal network activity. Here's a breakdown of the indicators:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.218.115.60) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for being a source of spam emails. This suggests that the traffic may be related to malicious activities.
2. **Destination IP**: The destination IP address (172.31.69.25) is an internal IP address, which is unusual for external communication. This could indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized access to an internal system.
3. **Protocol and Port**: The protocol used is TCP (protocol 6), and the destination port is 80, which is typically associated with HTTP traffic. However, the source port (61512) is non-standard and may indicate a malicious application or service.
4. **TCP Flags**: The cumulative TCP flags (223) and client TCP flags (222) are unusual and may indicate scanning or probing activities.
5. **Flow Duration**: The flow duration (4294936 milliseconds) is relatively long, which could suggest a persistent connection, potentially indicating an attacker maintaining access to a system.
6. **Packet Size**: The longest packet size (1004 bytes) and shortest packet size (40 bytes) deviate from normal HTTP traffic, which typically has smaller packet sizes.
7. **Throughput**: The average throughput (56000 bps for src-to-dst and 528000 bps for dst-to-src) is relatively high, indicating a significant amount of data being transferred.

Considering these indicators, the NetFlow data is likely malicious due to the following reasons:

* The source IP address has a history of spam email activity.
* The destination IP address is an internal IP, which is unusual for external communication.
* The protocol and port combination (TCP on port 61512) is non-standard.
* The TCP flags and flow duration suggest scanning or probing activities.
* The packet size and throughput deviate from normal HTTP traffic.

Overall, this NetFlow data appears to be related to malicious activity, potentially involving data exfiltration or unauthorized access to an internal system.
