The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) has flagged the following NetFlow data as malicious based on several indicators that deviate from normal network activity. Let's analyze the provided NetFlow sample to understand why it is considered malicious:

### Malicious NetFlow:
- **IPV4_SRC_ADDR**: 18.219.9.1
- **L4_SRC_PORT**: 50153
- **IPV4_DST_ADDR**: 172.31.69.28
- **L4_DST_PORT**: 80
- **PROTOCOL**: 6 (TCP)
- **L7_PROTO**: 7.0 (HTTP)
- **IN_BYTES**: 471
- **IN_PKTS**: 5
- **OUT_BYTES**: 1147
- **OUT_PKTS**: 5
- **TCP_FLAGS**: 219
- **CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS**: 219
- **SERVER_TCP_FLAGS**: 27
- **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS**: 4294959
- **DURATION_IN**: 7
- **DURATION_OUT**: 7
- **MIN_TTL**: 127
- **MAX_TTL**: 127
- **LONGEST_FLOW_PKT**: 975
- **SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT**: 40
- **MIN_IP_PKT_LEN**: 40
- **MAX_IP_PKT_LEN**: 975
- **SRC_TO_DST_SECOND_BYTES**: 471.0
- **DST_TO_SRC_SECOND_BYTES**: 1147.0
- **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES**: 0
- **RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS**: 0
- **RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES**: 0
- **RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS**: 0
- **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT**: 464000
- **DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT**: 1144000
- **NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES**: 8
- **NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES**: 0
- **NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES**: 1
- **NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES**: 1
- **NUM_PKTS_1024_TO_1514_BYTES**: 0
- **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN**: 65535
- **TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT**: 26883

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Known Malicious Source IP**:
   - The source IP address (18.219.9.1) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been flagged in multiple attack patterns. This historical context alone raises suspicion about the traffic originating from this IP.

2. **Unusual Flow Duration**:
   - The flow duration is extremely high (4294959 milliseconds, which is approximately 49.7 days). Such a long duration is unusual for typical HTTP traffic and could indicate a persistent connection, which might be used for maintaining access or exfiltrating data slowly over time.

3. **High TCP Flags Value**:
   - The TCP flags value of 219 (binary: 11011011) indicates a combination of flags that include SYN, ACK, FIN, and URG. This combination is atypical for normal HTTP traffic and might suggest scanning or other malicious activities.

4. **Consistent TTL Values**:
   - The minimum and maximum TTL values are both 127. While consistent TTL values are not inherently malicious, they can indicate that the packets are crafted or manipulated, especially when combined with other suspicious indicators.

5. **High Throughput**:
   - The average throughput values are relatively high (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 464000 bps, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 1144000 bps). High throughput can be indicative of large data transfers, which might be associated with data exfiltration.

6. **Packet Size Distribution**:
   - The distribution of packet sizes shows a high number of small packets (NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 8) and a few larger packets (NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES: 1). This pattern can be indicative of command and control traffic or data exfiltration where small packets are used for commands and larger packets for data transfer.

### Comparison with Previous Connections:

Previous connections involving the destination IP (172.31.69.28) and other external IPs (e.g., 18.218.55.126) also show similar patterns:
- High TCP flags values (219) indicating unusual flag combinations.
- Long flow durations (4294953 and 4294902 milliseconds).
- Consistent TTL values (127).
- High throughput values.

### Conclusion:

The NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to a combination of factors:
- Source IP is known for malicious activities.
- Unusually long flow duration.
- Atypical TCP flags combination.
- High throughput indicating potential data exfiltration.
- Consistent TTL values suggesting packet manipulation.
- Packet size distribution indicative of command and control or data exfiltration.

These indicators collectively suggest that the traffic is part of a malicious activity, possibly involving data exfiltration or maintaining persistent access to the internal network.
