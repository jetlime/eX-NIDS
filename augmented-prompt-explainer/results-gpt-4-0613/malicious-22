The provided NetFlow data has been flagged as malicious due to several indicators that align with known patterns of malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis citing specific feature values:

### Source and Destination Information:
- **Source IP (IPV4_SRC_ADDR):** 18.216.24.42
  - This IP address originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and is recognized as part of a DDoS botnet.
- **Destination IP (IPV4_DST_ADDR):** 172.31.69.28
  - This is an internal IP address, indicating that the traffic is targeting an internal network resource.

### Protocol Information:
- **Protocol (PROTOCOL):** 6 (TCP)
- **Layer 7 Protocol (L7_PROTO):** 7.0 (HTTP)
  - The use of HTTP over TCP is standard, but it is crucial to consider the context and behavior of the traffic.

### Traffic Volume and Packet Information:
- **IN_BYTES:** 496
- **OUT_BYTES:** 1147
- **IN_PKTS:** 5
- **OUT_PKTS:** 5
- **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS:** 4294964

### Anomalous Behavior Indicators:
1. **High Traffic Volume and Throughput:**
   - **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT:** 992000 bps
   - **DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT:** 2288000 bps
   - The high throughput values indicate a significant amount of data being transferred in a short duration, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or a DDoS attack.

2. **Flow Duration:**
   - **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS:** 4294964 ms (approximately 71.6 minutes)
   - The unusually long flow duration is suspicious, as it suggests a persistent connection, which is often associated with malicious activities such as maintaining access to a system.

3. **TCP Flags:**
   - **TCP_FLAGS:** 219 (SYN, ACK, FIN, PSH)
   - **CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS:** 219
   - **SERVER_TCP_FLAGS:** 27 (SYN, ACK)
   - The combination of TCP flags indicates unusual behavior. The presence of SYN, ACK, FIN, and PSH flags together is not typical for regular traffic and may indicate scanning or other reconnaissance activities.

4. **Packet Size:**
   - **LONGEST_FLOW_PKT:** 975 bytes
   - **SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT:** 40 bytes
   - **MIN_IP_PKT_LEN:** 40 bytes
   - **MAX_IP_PKT_LEN:** 975 bytes
   - The variation in packet sizes, especially the presence of very small and relatively large packets, can be indicative of an attempt to evade detection or perform reconnaissance.

5. **TTL Values:**
   - **MIN_TTL:** 127
   - **MAX_TTL:** 127
   - The consistent TTL values suggest that the packets are likely coming from the same source without much variation, which is common in automated or scripted attacks.

### Historical Context:
- Previous connections from similar IP addresses (18.218.55.126 and 18.216.200.189) to the same destination IP (172.31.69.28) with similar behavior patterns further support the suspicion of malicious activity. These connections also exhibited high throughput, long durations, and unusual TCP flag combinations.

### Conclusion:
The NetFlow data is considered malicious primarily due to the following reasons:
- The source IP is known to be part of a DDoS botnet.
- The traffic exhibits high throughput and long flow durations, which are indicative of potential data exfiltration or DDoS attacks.
- The combination of TCP flags and packet size variations suggests scanning or reconnaissance activities.
- Historical patterns of similar behavior from related IP addresses reinforce the suspicion.

These indicators collectively point towards malicious intent, warranting further investigation and appropriate security measures.
