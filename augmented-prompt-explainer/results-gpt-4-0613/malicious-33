The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) has flagged the following NetFlow data as malicious. Let's analyze the specific feature values present in the NetFlow sample to understand why it is considered malicious:

### Malicious NetFlow Data:
- **IPV4_SRC_ADDR:** 18.216.200.189

- **L4_DST_PORT:** 80
- **PROTOCOL:** 6 (TCP)
- **L7_PROTO:** 7.0 (HTTP)
- **IN_BYTES:** 232
- **IN_PKTS:** 5
- **OUT_BYTES:** 1136
- **OUT_PKTS:** 4
- **TCP_FLAGS:** 223
- **CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS:** 222
- **SERVER_TCP_FLAGS:** 27
- **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS:** 0
- **DURATION_IN:** 0
- **DURATION_OUT:** 0
- **MIN_TTL:** 127
- **MAX_TTL:** 127
- **LONGEST_FLOW_PKT:** 1004
- **SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT:** 40
- **MIN_IP_PKT_LEN:** 40

- **NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES:** 0
- **NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES:** 0
- **NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES:** 1
- **NUM_PKTS_1024_TO_1514_BYTES:** 0
- **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN:** 8192
- **TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT:** 26883

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Source IP Reputation:**
   - The source IP address `18.216.200.189` has been flagged for SSH brute-force attempts. This indicates a history of malicious activity associated with this IP.

2. **Unusual TCP Flags:**
   - The cumulative TCP flags value is `223`, which is unusual. Normal TCP communication typically involves flags like SYN, ACK, FIN, and RST. The value `223` indicates a combination of flags that may include SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, PSH, and URG, which is not typical for standard HTTP traffic and may suggest an attempt to manipulate the TCP connection.

3. **Zero Flow Duration:**
   - The `FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS` is `0`, which means the flow was extremely short-lived or terminated abruptly. This is unusual for HTTP traffic, which typically has a measurable duration.

4. **High Throughput with Low Packet Count:**
   - The `SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT` is `1856000` bps and `DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT` is `9088000` bps, which are very high values given the low number of packets (`IN_PKTS: 5`, `OUT_PKTS: 4`). This discrepancy suggests an abnormal data transfer pattern.

5. **TTL Values:**
   - Both `MIN_TTL` and `MAX_TTL` are `127`, which is high and could indicate that the packets are coming from a source relatively close in the network topology. However, this uniformity can also be a sign of packet manipulation.

6. **Packet Size Anomalies:**
   - The `LONGEST_FLOW_PKT` is `1004` bytes, and the `SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT` is `40` bytes. The presence of a very large packet and very small packets in the same flow can indicate attempts to exploit buffer overflows or other vulnerabilities.

7. **TCP Window Size:**
   - The `TCP_WIN_MAX_IN` is `8192`, which is relatively small compared to the `TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT` of `26883`. This could indicate an attempt to throttle the connection or manipulate the TCP window size for evasion or attack purposes.

### Conclusion:
The combination of an IP address with a known malicious history, unusual TCP flag combinations, zero flow duration, high throughput with a low packet count, uniform high TTL values, and packet size anomalies collectively indicate suspicious behavior. These features suggest that the flow could be part of a reconnaissance activity, an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, or data exfiltration.

Given these indicators, the NetFlow data is rightly flagged as malicious by the Network Intrusion Detection System.
