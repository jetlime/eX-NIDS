### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Reputation of Source IP:**
   - The source IP address (18.219.32.43) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known to be part of a DDoS attack. This historical context alone raises suspicion regarding any traffic originating from this IP.

2. **Internal Destination IP:**
   - The destination IP address (172.31.69.28) is an internal IP address. External IPs communicating with internal IPs, especially on ports commonly used for web traffic (port 80), can be indicative of malicious activity such as data exfiltration or unauthorized access attempts.

3. **High TCP Flags Value:**
   - The TCP flags value (219) is unusual and suggests that multiple TCP flags are set. This could indicate scanning or other non-standard TCP behaviors. The specific combination of flags could be indicative of a reconnaissance or an attempt to bypass standard TCP/IP stack protections.

4. **Flow Duration:**
   - The flow duration is extremely long (4294936 milliseconds, which is approximately 49.7 days). This is highly abnormal for typical HTTP traffic, which usually consists of shorter-lived connections. Such long durations could indicate persistent connections used for maintaining unauthorized access.

5. **Consistent TTL Values:**
   - The minimum and maximum TTL values are both 127. While not inherently malicious, consistent TTL values across multiple packets can sometimes indicate spoofed traffic or traffic generated by automated tools.

6. **Unusual Packet Sizes:**
   - The longest packet size (975 bytes) and the shortest packet size (40 bytes) show a wide range of packet sizes. While not definitive on its own, this can sometimes be indicative of non-standard traffic patterns.

7. **High Throughput Values:**
   - The average throughput values (112000 bps src-to-dst and 280000 bps dst-to-src) are relatively high. Combined with the long flow duration, this could indicate a significant amount of data being transferred, which could be a sign of data exfiltration.

8. **Previous Connections:**
   - The historical context provided shows multiple connections from similar IP addresses (18.219.9.1, 18.219.32.43, 18.216.200.189) to internal IPs on port 80. This pattern of repeated connections from related IPs to internal IPs is consistent with reconnaissance or the establishment of a persistent connection.

### Conclusion:
The flagged NetFlow data is considered malicious due to the combination of a known malicious source IP, unusual TCP flag values, excessively long flow duration, high throughput values, and historical context showing similar patterns of connections. These factors collectively suggest that this traffic is not typical and likely represents an attempt to perform unauthorized activities within the network, such as data exfiltration, reconnaissance, or maintaining persistent access.
