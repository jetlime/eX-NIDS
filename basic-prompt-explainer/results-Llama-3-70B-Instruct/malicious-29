Based on the provided NetFlow data, I'll analyze the features that suggest this traffic is malicious.

**Suspicious Features:**

1. **Unusual source port**: The source port (33360) is not a commonly used port for legitimate traffic. This could indicate an attempt to evade detection or exploit a vulnerability.
2. **High throughput**: The average throughput values (120000 and 160000) are unusually high, suggesting a potential data transfer or exfiltration activity.
3. **Retransmitted packets**: The presence of retransmitted packets (398 bytes, 1 packet) indicates potential connection issues or attempts to reestablish a connection.
4. **Unusual protocol usage**: The L7_PROTO value (7.0) is not a standard protocol number. This could indicate an attempt to use a non-standard or custom protocol for malicious purposes.
5. **ICMP type**: The ICMP type value (36352) is not a commonly seen value, which might suggest an attempt to use ICMP for malicious purposes.

**Additional Observations:**

1. **Flow duration**: The flow duration (4294764 milliseconds) is relatively long, which could indicate a prolonged connection or data transfer.
2. **Packet size distribution**: The packet size distribution shows a mix of small and large packets, with a longest packet length of 987 bytes. This could be indicative of a data transfer or exfiltration activity.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the unusual feature values present in this NetFlow sample, I conclude that this traffic is likely malicious. The suspicious features, such as the unusual source port, high throughput, retransmitted packets, and unusual protocol usage, suggest an attempt to evade detection or exploit a vulnerability. Further investigation is recommended to determine the nature of the malicious activity and take appropriate action to mitigate any potential threats.
