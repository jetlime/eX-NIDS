Based on the provided NetFlow data, I'll analyze the features that suggest this traffic is malicious.

**1. Unusual Port Number:** The source port (L4_SRC_PORT) is 55590, which is not a common port number for legitimate traffic. This could indicate an attempt to evade detection or exploit a vulnerability.

**2. Protocol and L7_PROTO Values:** The protocol is TCP (6), and the L7PROTO value is 7.0, indicating that the traffic is using an SSL/TLS layer on top of TCP. While this is not unusual in itself, it's worth noting that some malware and botnets use SSL/TLS to communicate with command and control servers.

**3. High Throughput:** The average throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT) are relatively high, indicating a significant amount of data is being transferred. This could be a sign of data exfiltration or DDoS activity.

**4. Packet Distribution:** The distribution of packet sizes is unusual, with a large number of packets in the 256-512 byte range (NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES) and a smaller number of packets in other ranges. This could indicate an attempt to evade detection by using non-standard packet sizes.

**5. TCP Flags:** The TCP flags values (TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS) are all 27, which is unusual. This could indicate that the traffic is using custom or malicious TCP implementations.

**6. Flow Duration:** The flow duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS) is approximately 4294 seconds, which is a relatively long time for a single connection. This could be a sign of an ongoing malicious activity.

**7. Retransmitted Packets:** There are retransmitted packets in both directions (RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS), which may indicate that the connection is experiencing issues or that the traffic is being intentionally delayed.

Considering these features, I believe this NetFlow data is malicious due to the unusual port number, high throughput, unusual packet distribution, and custom TCP flags. The long flow duration and retransmitted packets also suggest ongoing malicious activity.
