The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several reasons:

1. High Number of Packets: The IN_PKTS and OUT_PKTS values are 23 and 19 respectively. This high number of packets could indicate a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

2. Unusual TCP Flags: The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS all have a value of 27. This is unusual and could indicate malicious activity such as port scanning or other types of reconnaissance.

3. Retransmitted Packets: The RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS values are 349 and 1 respectively. This could indicate a network issue, but it could also be a sign of malicious activity such as a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.

4. High Flow Duration: The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS value is 4294795, which is quite high. This could indicate a long-lasting connection, which is often a sign of a botnet or other type of persistent threat.

5. Unusual ICMP Type: The ICMP_TYPE value is 23808, which is not a standard ICMP type. This could indicate an attempt to use ICMP for malicious purposes, such as a Smurf attack or ICMP tunneling.

6. High Throughput: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT values are 128000 and 216000 respectively. This high throughput could indicate a data exfiltration attempt.

7. Unusual Packet Sizes: The NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES, NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES, and NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES values are 33, 5, and 4 respectively. This distribution of packet sizes is unusual and could indicate an attempt to evade detection.

These are just a few of the potential indicators of malicious activity in this NetFlow data. A more thorough analysis would likely reveal additional signs of malicious activity.
