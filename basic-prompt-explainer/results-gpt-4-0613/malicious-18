The NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 80**: This is the default port for HTTP traffic. Malicious actors often use this port to blend in with normal web traffic.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in many types of attacks due to its connection-oriented nature.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 219, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 219, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27**: These values are suspicious because they indicate unusual TCP flag combinations. TCP flags are used to control the state of a TCP connection, and unusual combinations can indicate malicious activity.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294935**: This is a very long flow duration, which could indicate a slow data exfiltration attempt or a long-term command and control communication.

5. **MIN_TTL: 127, MAX_TTL: 127**: These values indicate that the Time to Live (TTL) for the packets in this flow did not change. This is unusual because TTL values typically decrease as packets traverse the network.

6. **LONGEST_FLOW_PKT: 975, SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT: 40, MIN_IP_PKT_LEN: 40, MAX_IP_PKT_LEN: 975**: These values indicate a large variation in packet sizes, which could be a sign of data exfiltration or other malicious activity.

7. **SRC_TO_DST_SECOND_BYTES: 528.0, DST_TO_SRC_SECOND_BYTES: 1147.0**: These values indicate a large amount of data being sent from the destination to the source, which could be a sign of data exfiltration.

8. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 128000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 272000**: These values indicate a high average throughput, which could be a sign of a data exfiltration attempt.

9. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 65535, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 26883**: These values indicate a large TCP window size, which could be a sign of a buffer overflow attack or other malicious activity.

In conclusion, the combination of these suspicious feature values could indicate a variety of malicious activities, including data exfiltration, command and control communication, or a buffer overflow attack.
