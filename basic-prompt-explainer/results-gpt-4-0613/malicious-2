The NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to several suspicious feature values that indicate potential malicious activity. Here are some of the key reasons:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 80**: This is the default port for HTTP traffic. If the source IP is not a web server but is sending data to this port, it could indicate an attempt to exploit HTTP vulnerabilities.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in many types of cyber attacks due to its reliable data transmission.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27**: The TCP flags field is set to 27, which corresponds to the combination of SYN, FIN, and ACK flags. This is unusual because SYN and FIN flags are not typically set in the same TCP segment. This could indicate a TCP Split Handshake attack or other types of malicious TCP behavior.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294795**: The flow duration is quite long, which could indicate a slow data exfiltration attempt or a slow DoS attack.

5. **MIN_TTL: 63, MAX_TTL: 63**: The TTL (Time to Live) values are the same. This is unusual as TTL values typically decrease as packets traverse through networks. This could indicate that the source and destination are in the same network or that the TTL is being manipulated, which is a common technique in some types of attacks.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_SECOND_BYTES: 2582.0, DST_TO_SRC_SECOND_BYTES: 4812.0**: The amount of data being sent from the source to the destination and vice versa is quite high. This could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a DoS attack.

7. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 112000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 216000**: The average throughput is quite high, which could indicate a high volume of data being transferred in a short amount of time. This could be a sign of a data exfiltration attempt or a DoS attack.

8. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 26883, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 26847**: The maximum TCP window size for both incoming and outgoing traffic is quite high. This could indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target system or network.

These are just a few of the suspicious feature values in the NetFlow data. A more detailed analysis would require additional context and potentially additional data.
