The NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to several suspicious feature values that indicate potential malicious activity. Here are some of the key reasons:

1. **High TCP Flags**: The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS values are unusually high (219 and 27 respectively). These flags are used to control the state of a TCP connection and high values could indicate an attempt to exploit TCP vulnerabilities or perform a TCP flood attack.

2. **Large Data Transfer**: The IN_BYTES and OUT_BYTES values (511 and 1147 respectively) indicate a large amount of data being transferred. This could suggest data exfiltration, especially if the source IP is not recognized or trusted.

3. **High Port Number**: The L4_SRC_PORT is 61832, which is a high port number typically used for ephemeral connections. Malicious software often uses these high ports to communicate with command and control servers.

4. **Long Flow Duration**: The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS is 4294964, which is quite long. Long-lasting connections could indicate a persistent threat, such as a botnet connection or a long-term data exfiltration effort.

5. **High Throughput**: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT values are 1360000 and 3056000 respectively, which are quite high. This could indicate a high volume of data being transferred at a high speed, which is often a sign of data exfiltration or a DoS attack.

6. **TCP Window Size**: The TCP_WIN_MAX_IN is 65535, which is the maximum possible value. This could indicate an attempt to perform a TCP Window Size attack, where the attacker manipulates the window size to disrupt the flow of data.

These are just a few potential reasons why the NetFlow data could be flagged as malicious. Further investigation would be needed to confirm the nature of the threat.
