The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 80**: This is the default port for HTTP traffic. While not inherently malicious, it is often targeted by attackers due to its widespread use.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This represents the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in many types of cyber attacks due to its reliable data delivery.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27**: The TCP flags field is set to 27, which corresponds to the combination of SYN, ACK, and RST flags. This is unusual because SYN and ACK are used to establish a connection, while RST is used to abruptly close a connection. This could indicate a SYN flood attack, where the attacker rapidly opens and closes connections to overwhelm the server.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294717**: The flow duration is quite long, which could indicate a slow and persistent attack, such as a slowloris attack.

5. **SRC_TO_DST_SECOND_BYTES: 2571675.0, DST_TO_SRC_SECOND_BYTES: 48641203.0**: The data rate from the source to the destination and vice versa is very high. This could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a DDoS attack.

6. **RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 987, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 1**: There are retransmitted packets, which could indicate network congestion, packet loss, or a potential attack.

7. **NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 42**: A large number of small packets could be indicative of a DoS attack, where the attacker sends a large number of small packets to overwhelm the server.

8. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 26883, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 26847**: The TCP window size is quite large, which could indicate a potential buffer overflow attack.

These suspicious feature values, when considered together, suggest that the network traffic could be malicious. However, further investigation would be needed to confirm this.
