The NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to several suspicious feature values that indicate potential malicious activity. Here are some of the key reasons:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 80**: This is the default port for HTTP traffic. If the source IP is not a trusted one, it could be an attempt to exploit HTTP vulnerabilities.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is often used in various types of attacks, such as SYN flood attacks, TCP/IP hijacking, etc.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 219, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 219, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27**: The TCP flags field is used to control how TCP functions. An unusual combination of flags can indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP protocol. The high value of 219 for both the source and destination suggests unusual TCP behavior.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294964**: This is a very long flow duration, which could indicate a slow data exfiltration attempt or a slowloris attack, which aims to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible.

5. **MIN_TTL: 127, MAX_TTL: 127**: TTL (Time to Live) values are decreased at each hop in the network. If the TTL values are not decreasing, it could indicate that the packets are not traversing multiple hops, which is unusual and could suggest a direct attack from within the network.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 1072000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 2288000**: The average throughput from source to destination and vice versa are quite high, which could indicate a data exfiltration attempt.

7. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 65535, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 26883**: The TCP window size is the amount of data that a machine can receive during a TCP session and still be able to process. A high incoming window size could indicate an attempt to overwhelm the system with data, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

These are just a few of the suspicious feature values. A comprehensive analysis would require more context and potentially additional data.
