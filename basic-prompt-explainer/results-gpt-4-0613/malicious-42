The NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to several suspicious feature values that indicate potential malicious activity. Here are some of the key reasons:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 80**: This is the default port for HTTP traffic. If the source IP is not a web server but is sending data to this port, it could indicate an attempt to exploit HTTP vulnerabilities.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This represents the TCP protocol, which is often used in various types of attacks due to its connection-oriented nature.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 219, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 219, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27**: The TCP flags field is used to control the state of a TCP connection. The values here are unusual and could indicate an attempt to manipulate the TCP connection for malicious purposes.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294964**: This is a relatively long flow duration, which could indicate a slow data exfiltration attempt or a slowloris attack, which aims to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible.

5. **MIN_TTL: 127, MAX_TTL: 127**: TTL (Time to Live) values are used to limit the lifespan of data in a network. A consistent TTL value across all packets in a flow is unusual and could indicate a scripted or automated process, which is common in many types of attacks.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 1472000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 3056000**: The average throughput from the source to the destination is significantly lower than the throughput from the destination to the source. This could indicate a data exfiltration attempt, where the attacker is trying to send data from the target network to their own system.

7. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 65535, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 26883**: The TCP window size is used to control the amount of data that can be sent at one time without receiving an acknowledgement. The maximum incoming window size is significantly larger than the outgoing window size, which could indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target system with data, a common tactic in Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

These are just some of the suspicious feature values in this NetFlow data. A thorough investigation would require additional context and potentially other data sources.
