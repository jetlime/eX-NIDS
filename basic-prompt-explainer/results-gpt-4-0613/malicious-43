The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. L4_DST_PORT: 22 - This is the port for SSH (Secure Shell), which is often targeted for brute force attacks or unauthorized access attempts.

2. PROTOCOL: 6 - This is the protocol number for TCP, which is commonly used in many types of cyber attacks.

3. TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27 - The TCP flags value of 27 indicates that the SYN, ACK, and RST flags are set. This is unusual because typically, the RST flag is not set along with the SYN and ACK flags. This could indicate a TCP SYN flood attack, which is a type of denial-of-service attack.

4. FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0 - These values indicate that the flow duration was extremely short, which is unusual and could suggest malicious activity such as a scan or a flood attack.

5. SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 25440000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 30952000 - These high throughput values could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a denial-of-service attack.

6. NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 35, NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES: 7, NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES: 1, NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES: 2, NUM_PKTS_1024_TO_1514_BYTES: 1 - The distribution of packet sizes is unusual and could suggest a scan or an attack.

7. TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 26883, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 26847 - These high TCP window size values could indicate a buffer overflow attack.

In conclusion, the combination of these suspicious feature values suggests that the network traffic is likely malicious.
