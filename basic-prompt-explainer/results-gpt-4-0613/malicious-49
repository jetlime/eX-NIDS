The NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 80**: This is the default port for HTTP traffic. An attacker might use this port to blend in with normal web traffic and avoid detection.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in many types of attacks due to its reliable and ordered data delivery.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 219, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 219, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27**: These values are unusual and suggest that the TCP handshake may not be following the standard procedure. This could indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the TCP protocol.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294921**: This is a relatively long flow duration, which could indicate a slow data exfiltration attempt or a long-lasting DoS attack.

5. **MIN_TTL: 127, MAX_TTL: 127**: The Time to Live (TTL) values are the same, which is unusual. This could indicate that the packets are being manipulated to avoid detection or to bypass certain network restrictions.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_SECOND_BYTES: 521.0, DST_TO_SRC_SECOND_BYTES: 1147.0**: The number of bytes sent per second from the source to the destination and from the destination to the source are significantly different. This could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a DoS attack.

7. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 88000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 192000**: The average throughput from the source to the destination and from the destination to the source are significantly different. This could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a DoS attack.

8. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 65535, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 26883**: The maximum TCP window size values are significantly different. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate the TCP window size to avoid detection or to bypass certain network restrictions.

These suspicious feature values suggest that the network traffic may be malicious. However, further investigation is needed to confirm this and to identify the specific type of attack.
