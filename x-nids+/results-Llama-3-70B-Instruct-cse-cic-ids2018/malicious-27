Based on the provided NetFlow data, this traffic is considered malicious due to several features that deviate from normal network activity. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious indicators:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.219.5.43) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for involvement in DDoS attacks. This raises concerns about the legitimacy of the traffic.
2. **Protocol and Port**: The use of TCP protocol (6) with a destination port of 80 (HTTP) is unusual, as it's not a common combination for internal IP addresses (172.31.69.28). This might indicate an attempt to communicate with an internal system using an unconventional protocol.
3. **TCP Flags**: The cumulative TCP flags (219) and client TCP flags (219) are unusual, indicating potential scanning or malicious activities. The server TCP flags (27) also seem irregular.
4. **Flow Duration**: The flow duration of 4294964 milliseconds is unusually long, which may indicate a persistent connection that deviates from normal session durations.
5. **Packet Size**: The longest packet size (975 bytes) and shortest packet size (40 bytes) are unusual, with a significant difference between them. This could be an indication of anomalous packet sizes.
6. **Throughput**: The average throughput values (1360000 and 3056000 bps) are higher than expected for internal traffic, which may indicate data exfiltration or other malicious activities.
7. **Packet Distribution**: The distribution of packets across different size ranges is unusual, with a high number of packets in the 256-512 byte range (1 packet) and a low number of packets in other ranges.

Considering these features, it's likely that this NetFlow data represents malicious activity, such as an attempt to communicate with an internal system using unconventional protocols or ports, potentially for data exfiltration or reconnaissance purposes.
