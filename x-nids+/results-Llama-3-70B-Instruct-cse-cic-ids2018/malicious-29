The Network Intrusion Detection System has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to several indicators that suggest anomalous behavior. Here's a breakdown of the features that led to this classification:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.219.193.20) is known for SSH brute-force activity, which raises suspicions about the intentions behind this connection.
2. **Protocol and Port**: The use of TCP protocol (6) with an unusual port number (33360) may indicate a non-standard or malicious application. Additionally, the destination port (80) suggests an attempt to communicate with a web server, which is uncommon for this source IP address.
3. **L7 Protocol**: The L7 protocol (HTTP, 7.0) is consistent with web traffic, but its combination with an unusual port and source IP address raises suspicions.
4. **Traffic Volume**: Although the total bytes transferred (IN_BYTES: 2941, OUT_BYTES: 4812) are not extremely high, the packet count (IN_PKTS: 22, OUT_PKTS: 20) is relatively low, which may indicate a slow and stealthy data transfer attempt.
5. **TCP Flags**: The cumulative TCP flags (27) suggest an unusual combination of flags, which may be indicative of scanning or malicious activities.
6. **Flow Duration**: The flow duration (4294764 milliseconds) is relatively long, which could indicate a persistent connection, potentially allowing the attacker to maintain access to the system.
7. **Packet Size Distribution**: The distribution of packet sizes (LONGEST_ FLOW_PKT: 987, SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT: 52) shows a significant variation, which may be an attempt to evade detection by using different packet sizes.
8. **Throughput**: The average throughput (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 120000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 160000) is relatively high, indicating a potential data exfiltration attempt.

Considering these indicators, the Network Intrusion Detection System has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to its suspicious characteristics, which may be indicative of a data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communication attempt.
