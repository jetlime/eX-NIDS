The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to the following features:

1. **Uncommon protocol usage**: The L7 protocol (244) corresponds to DNP3, which is an IoT-Scada protocol. This is unusual for internal network traffic, and its presence may indicate a potential IoT-related attack or unauthorized access.
2. **Anomalous packet size**: The LONGEST_FLOW_PKT (44) and SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT (40) values are unusually small. This deviation in average packet size could be indicative of malicious activity, such as scanning or data exfiltration attempts.
3. **Unusual TCP flags**: The TCP_FLAGS value (22) is unusual, and the combination of CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS (2) and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS (20) may indicate port scanning activities or other malicious behaviors.
4. **High throughput**: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT (352000) and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT (320000) values are relatively high, which could be indicative of data exfiltration attempts or unauthorized data transfers.

Given these features, the NetFlow data is considered malicious because it exhibits unusual protocol usage, packet sizes, and TCP flags, as well as high throughput. These indicators may suggest a potential IoT-related attack, data exfiltration attempt, or other malicious activity on the internal network.
