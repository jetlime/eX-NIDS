The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several features that deviate from normal network activity. Here's a breakdown of the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.219.32.43) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for being part of a DDoS attack. This suggests that the traffic may be malicious or related to a previous attack.
2. **Destination IP**: The destination IP address (172.31.69.28) is an internal IP address, which is unusual considering the source IP is external. This could indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized access to the internal network.
3. **Protocol and L7 Protocol**: The protocol used is TCP (6), and the Layer 7 protocol is HTTP (7.0). While this is a common combination for web traffic, it's unusual in the context of an internal IP address as the destination.
4. **TCP Flags**: The cumulative TCP flags (219) and client TCP flags (219) are unusual. This may indicate scanning or malicious activities, such as port scanning or data exfiltration.
5. **Flow Duration**: The flow duration is 4294964 milliseconds, which is an unusually long connection duration. This could indicate a persistent connection, potentially allowing an attacker to maintain access to the system.
6. **Packet Size Distribution**: The longest packet size (975 bytes) and shortest packet size (40 bytes) are unusual. This may indicate anomalous packet sizes, which could be used for data exfiltration or other malicious activities.
7. **Throughput**: The average throughput (1472000 bps and 3056000 bps) is relatively high, considering the flow duration and packet sizes. This could indicate a large amount of data being transferred, potentially related to data exfiltration.

Given these feature values, it's likely that this NetFlow data represents malicious activity, such as:

* Data exfiltration: The unusual packet sizes, high throughput, and internal destination IP address suggest that data may be being transferred out of the network.
* Unauthorized access: The persistent connection and unusual TCP flags may indicate that an attacker has gained unauthorized access to the system.
* Scanning or reconnaissance: The unusual protocol combination, TCP flags, and packet size distribution could be indicative of scanning or reconnaissance activities.

Overall, this NetFlow data exhibits several features that are uncommon in normal network activity, suggesting that it may be related to malicious activities.
