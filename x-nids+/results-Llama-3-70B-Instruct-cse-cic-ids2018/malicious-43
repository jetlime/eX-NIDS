The Network Intrusion Detection System has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to several suspicious features. Here's a breakdown of the reasons why:

1. **Source IP address**: The source IP address `13.58.98.64` originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for spam email activity. This raises concerns about the legitimacy of the traffic.
2. **Destination IP address**: The destination IP address `172.31.69.25` is an internal IP address, which may indicate that the traffic is attempting to access a system or service within the network.
3. **Protocol and port numbers**: The protocol used is TCP (protocol 6), and the destination port is 22, which is commonly associated with SSH (Secure Shell) connections. The L7 protocol 92 corresponds to the SSH protocol, which is unusual for this specific connection.
4. **Traffic volume and packet count**: The incoming bytes (`IN_BYTES`) and packets (`IN_PKTS`) are relatively low, but the outgoing bytes (`OUT_BYTES`) and packets (`OUT_PKTS`) are slightly higher. This could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or an attempt to establish a command and control (C&c) channel.
5. **TCP flags**: The cumulative TCP flags (`TCP_FLAGS`) and client/server TCP flags (`CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS` and `SERVER_TCP_FLAGS`) all have a value of 27, which is unusual and may indicate scanning or malicious activities.
6. **Flow duration**: The flow duration (`FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS`) is 0, indicating that the connection was very short-lived, which could be indicative of a reconnaissance or probing activity.
7. **Packet size distribution**: The packet sizes are distributed across various ranges (e.g., `NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES`, `NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES`, etc.), which may indicate an attempt to evade detection by using varying packet sizes.

Considering these features, the Network Intrusion Detection System has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to its suspicious characteristics, such as the source IP address, protocol and port numbers, traffic volume, TCP flags, flow duration, and packet size distribution.
