The provided NetFlow data has been flagged as malicious due to several suspicious features. Here's a breakdown of the indicators that suggest malicious activity:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (52.14.136.135) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for Botnet communication detected. This suggests that the traffic may be related to botnet activities.

2. **Low Traffic Volume**: The IN_BYTES (232) and OUT_BYTES (1136) values indicate a relatively low volume of traffic. This could be an attempt to avoid detection by keeping the traffic volumes low.

3. **Unexpected Protocol**: The L7_PROTO value (7.178) is not a standard HTTP protocol value, which may indicate an unusual or non-standard application protocol being used.

4. **Anomalous Packet Size**: The LONGEST_FLOW_PKT (1004) and SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT (40) values suggest deviations in average packet size, which could be indicative of scanning or other malicious activities.

5. **Unusual TCP Flags**: The TCP_FLAGS value (223) is an unusual combination of flags, which may indicate scanning or other malicious activities.

6. **Persistent Connection**: The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS value (4294936) indicates a long-lasting connection, which deviates from normal session durations and could be an attempt to maintain access to the system.

7. **Data Exfiltration**: Although the OUT_BYTES value is not extremely high, the DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT value (9088000) suggests a relatively large volume of outbound data, which may indicate data exfiltration attempts.

Considering these indicators, it's likely that this NetFlow data represents malicious activity, possibly related to botnet communication, data exfiltration, or other types of attacks.
