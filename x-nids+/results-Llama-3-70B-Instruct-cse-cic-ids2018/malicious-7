This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several feature values that deviate from normal network activity. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious indicators:

1. **Source IP**: The source IP address (18.219.193.20) originates from Hilliard, Ohio, United States, and has been known for SSH brute-force activity observed. This suggests that the traffic may be related to malicious activities.
2. **Protocol and Port**: The protocol used is TCP (6), which is a common protocol, but the destination port (80) is typically associated with HTTP traffic. However, in this case, the L7 protocol (7.0) indicates that the application protocol is HTTP, which is unusual for an internal IP address (172.31.69.25).
3. **Traffic Volume**: The incoming bytes (4088) and outgoing bytes (6015) are relatively high, indicating a significant amount of data transfer. This, combined with the short flow duration (4294717 milliseconds), may suggest data exfiltration or a potential DDoS attack.
4. **TCP Flags**: The cumulative TCP flags (27) and client/server TCP flags (both 27) indicate unusual flag combinations, which may be indicative of scanning or malicious activities.
5. **Retransmitted Packets**: There are retransmitted packets in both directions (IN_BYTES: 827, OUT_PKTS: 2), which could suggest failed connection attempts or data transfer issues.
6. **Packet Size Distribution**: The longest flow packet size is 987 bytes, and the shortest is 52 bytes, indicating a wide range of packet sizes. This, combined with the high traffic volume, may indicate an attempt to evade detection by using varied packet sizes.
7. **Throughput**: The average throughput (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 128000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 184000) is relatively high, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or a DDoS attack.

Considering these factors, the Network Intrusion Detection System has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to its unusual characteristics, which may indicate a potential data exfiltration attempt, DDoS attack, or other malicious activities.
