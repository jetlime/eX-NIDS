This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious features. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:

1. **Destination Port**: The destination port (L4_DST_PORT) is 80, which is typically used for HTTP traffic. However, the protocol (PROTOCOL) is 6, which corresponds to TCP. This mismatch raises suspicions, as HTTP usually uses UDP or TCP with a different port number.
2. **TCP Flags**: The client and server TCP flags (CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS) are both set to 219. This unusual combination of flags may indicate an attempt to bypass firewall rules or exploit a vulnerability.
3. **Flow Duration**: The flow duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS) is approximately 43 minutes, which is an unusually long time for a single flow. This could be an indication of a sustained attack or a malicious connection attempting to stay active for an extended period.
4. **Packet Length Distribution**: The distribution of packet lengths (MIN_IP_PKT_LEN to MAX_IP_PKT_LEN) shows a wide range of packet sizes, from 40 bytes to 975 bytes. This diversity may indicate an attempt to evade detection by using varying packet sizes.
5. **Throughput**: The average throughput (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT) is relatively high, with values of 144000 and 304000, respectively. This could be a sign of data exfiltration or an attempt to flood the network with malicious traffic.
6. **Packet Count Distribution**: The distribution of packet counts (NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES to NUM_PKTS_1024_TO_1514_BYTES) shows an unusual pattern, with a high number of packets in certain size ranges. This may indicate an attempt to send a large amount of data in a short period.

While these features don't necessarily prove malicious intent, their combination raises suspicions and warrants further investigation. The Network Intrusion Detection System has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to the unusual patterns and values present in the traffic.
