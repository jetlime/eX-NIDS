The malicious NetFlow data is considered suspicious based on several feature values that suggest potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the reasons:

1. **Unusual source port**: The source port (L4_SRC_PORT) is 52082, which is not a commonly used port for legitimate traffic. This could indicate an attempt to evade firewall rules or exploit a vulnerability.
2. **Destination port is HTTP (80)**: The destination port (L4_DST_PORT) is 80, which is the default port for HTTP. While this doesn't necessarily imply malicious activity, it's unusual to see a connection from a high-numbered source port to a well-known service port like HTTP.
3. **High throughput**: The average throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT) are unusually high, indicating a potential data transfer or exfiltration activity.
4. **Unusual packet lengths**: The distribution of packet lengths is unusual, with a high number of packets in the 256-512 byte range (NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES). This could indicate an attempt to send data in small, potentially encrypted chunks.
5. **No retransmitted packets**: The absence of retransmitted packets (RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES) suggests that the connection is not experiencing errors or packet loss, which is unusual for a high-throughput connection.
6. **TCP flags indicate potential malicious activity**: The TCP flags (TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS) suggest that the connection is using non-standard flags, which could be an attempt to evade detection or exploit a vulnerability.

While these features don't necessarily prove malicious activity, they are unusual enough to warrant further investigation. It's possible that this NetFlow data represents a legitimate connection, but the combination of these factors suggests that it's worth examining more closely to determine if it's related to malicious activity.
