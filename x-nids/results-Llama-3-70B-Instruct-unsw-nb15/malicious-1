Based on the NetFlow data provided, I'll explain why this traffic is considered malicious and highlight specific feature values that support my analysis.

**Reason for consideration as malicious:**

This NetFlow sample appears to be a potential scan or probe attempt, which can be indicative of malicious activity. Here are some features that led me to this conclusion:

1. **Uncommon port usage**: The source port (9979) is not a commonly used port for legitimate traffic. It may indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability or use an unusual protocol.
2. **Short flow duration**: The flow duration is 0 milliseconds, which suggests that the connection was very brief and might be a scan or probe attempt rather than a legitimate communication.
3. **High throughput**: The average throughput (4176000 bytes per second) is unusually high for a short-lived connection, indicating an attempt to send a large amount of data in a short time frame.
4. **Retransmitted packets**: There is one retransmitted packet (RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1), which could be an indication of a scan or probe attempt.
5. **Unusual TCP flags**: The TCP flags (19) suggest that the connection was not successfully established, which is consistent with a scan or probe attempt.

**Additional observations**:

* The protocol used is TCP (PROTOCOL: 6), and the L7 protocol is 0.0, indicating no specific application-layer protocol.
* The IP packet lengths are within normal ranges (MIN_IP_PKT_LEN: 40, MAX_IP_PKT_LEN: 85).
* There are no DNS queries or FTP commands, which reduces the likelihood of this being a legitimate communication.

In conclusion, based on these feature values, I believe that this NetFlow sample is considered malicious due to its unusual characteristics, such as short flow duration, high throughput, and retransmitted packets, which may indicate a scan or probe attempt.
