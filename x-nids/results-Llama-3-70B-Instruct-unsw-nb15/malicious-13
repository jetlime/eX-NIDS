The malicious NetFlow data is considered suspicious due to several feature values that suggest a potential attack or anomalous behavior. Here's a breakdown of the key indicators:

1. **Unusual port numbers**: The source port (1765) and destination port (179) are not commonly used for legitimate traffic. This might indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability or communicate with a malware command and control server.
2. **High throughput**: The average throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 678800000 and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 4608000) are unusually high, suggesting a potential data exfiltration or DDoS attack.
3. **Retransmitted packets**: The retransmitted packet counts (RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 31 and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 0) indicate that there were repeated attempts to send packets, which could be a sign of a TCP-based attack or a scanning activity.
4. **Packet size distribution**: The distribution of packet sizes (NUM_ PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 24, NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES: 0, ..., NUM_PKTS_1024_TO_1514_BYTES: 54) shows an unusual pattern, with a high number of packets in the larger size ranges. This might indicate an attempt to bypass firewalls or IDS systems.
5. **TCP flags**: The TCP flags (TCP_FLAGS: 19, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 19, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19) suggest that the connection was established using an unusual combination of flags, which could be a sign of a malicious actor attempting to evade detection.
6. **L7 protocol**: The L7 protocol value (13.0) is not a standard or well-known protocol, which might indicate a custom or proprietary communication protocol used by malware or attackers.

While these features alone do not necessarily prove malicious activity, their combination and unusual values suggest that this NetFlow data warrants further investigation to determine the nature of the traffic and potential threats it may pose.
