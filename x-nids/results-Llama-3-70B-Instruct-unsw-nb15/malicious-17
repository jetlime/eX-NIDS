The malicious NetFlow sample provided has several features that suggest it is malicious. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious indicators:

1. **Protocol:** The protocol used is 17, which corresponds to UDP (User Datagram Protocol). While UDP is a legitimate protocol, its use in this context is unusual.
2. **L4_SRC_PORT:** The source port 29860 is not a well-known port for any standard service, and it's unlikely that a legitimate service would use such a high-numbered port.
3. **L4_DST_PORT:** The destination port 520 is also not a commonly used port for standard services. Port 520 is not assigned by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) for any specific protocol or service.
4. **IN_BYTES:** The incoming bytes are 104, which is a relatively small amount of data. This, combined with the fact that there are only two packets (IN_PKTS: 2), suggests that this might be an attempt to send a small amount of malicious data.
5. **TCP_FLAGS:** All TCP flags are set to 0, indicating that no TCP options were used. This is unusual, as most legitimate TCP connections would have some flags set.
6. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS:** The flow duration is 0 milliseconds, which means the connection was extremely short-lived or didn't actually complete a full transaction.
7. **SRC_TO_DST_SECOND_BYTES:** The average throughput from source to destination is 832000 bytes per second, which is an unusually high rate for such a short-lived connection.

Given these features, it's likely that this NetFlow sample represents a malicious activity, possibly an attempt to send malware or execute a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The unusual port numbers, small packet sizes, and high throughput rates suggest that this traffic may not be legitimate.
