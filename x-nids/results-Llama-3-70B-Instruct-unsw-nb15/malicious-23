This NetFlow sample is considered malicious due to several suspicious features that indicate a potential exploitation of a vulnerability or an attempt to evade security controls.

Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Destination port 445**: This port is commonly associated with the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which has been known to be vulnerable to various exploits, including the EternalBlue exploit used in WannaCry and other malware outbreaks.
2. **Retransmitted packets**: The presence of retransmitted bytes (829) and packets (2) suggests that there may have been issues with packet delivery, which could indicate a network scanning or probing activity.
3. **TCP flags 19**: The TCP flags value of 19 indicates that the packet has both SYN and ACK flags set, which is unusual for a normal connection establishment process. This could be an attempt to bypass firewall rules or evade security controls.
4. **Short flow duration**: The flow duration is 0 milliseconds, indicating that the connection was very brief, which is consistent with scanning or probing activity rather than a legitimate network interaction.
5. **High throughput**: The average throughput values (16080000 and 5584000) are unusually high for a normal network communication, suggesting that the traffic may be generated by a malicious actor attempting to transfer data quickly.
6. **Unusual packet length distribution**: The distribution of packet lengths (e.g., 40, 652, and other values) is unusual and may indicate an attempt to evade security controls or fingerprinting systems.

Considering these features together, it is likely that this NetFlow sample represents malicious activity, such as a network scanning or probing activity, an exploit attempt, or even a malware communication. Further analysis and investigation are recommended to confirm the nature of this traffic.
