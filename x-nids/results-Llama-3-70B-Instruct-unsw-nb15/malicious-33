Based on the NetFlow data provided, I'll break down the features that suggest this traffic is malicious:

1. **Unusual source port**: The source port `L4_SRC_PORT: 57047` is not a commonly used port for legitimate traffic. This could indicate an attempt to evade firewalls or IDS systems.
2. **Destination port**: The destination port `L4_DST_PORT: 8080` is often associated with web-based attacks, such as web shell backdoors or malicious scripts.
3. **Protocol and L7 protocol values**: The combination of `PROTOCOL: 6` (TCP) and `L7_PROTO: 131.7` suggests that the traffic might be using an unusual or custom protocol on top of TCP. This could be an attempt to bypass traditional network security controls.
4. **High throughput**: The `SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT` value of `15872000` indicates a high average throughput from the source to destination, which is unusual for legitimate traffic. This could suggest a data exfiltration or DDoS attack.
5. **Retransmitted packets**: The presence of retransmitted packets (`RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 816` and `RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1`) might indicate an attempt to exploit TCP vulnerabilities or engage in malicious activities like packet injection attacks.
6. **Unusual packet lengths**: The range of packet lengths (`MIN_IP_PKT_LEN: 40`, `MAX_IP_PKT_LEN: 816`) is unusual and could be an attempt to evade network security controls.
7. **Lack of DNS query information**: The absence of DNS query information (`DNS_QUERY_ID: 0` and `DNS_QUERY_TYPE: 0`) might suggest that the traffic is not related to legitimate DNS activity.

Considering these features, it's likely that this NetFlow data represents malicious activity, such as a web-based attack, data exfiltration, or an attempt to exploit TCP vulnerabilities.
