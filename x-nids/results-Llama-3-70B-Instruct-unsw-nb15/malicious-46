Based on the provided NetFlow data, I'll analyze the features that suggest this traffic is malicious.

**Suspicious Features:**

1. **Retransmitted packets**: The presence of retransmitted packets (RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 2 and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 2) indicates potential connection issues or network congestion, which can be indicative of malicious activity.
2. **Unusual protocol usage**: The combination of PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP) and L7_PROTO: 7.0 (unassigned) is unusual. This could suggest an attempt to bypass traditional TCP/UDP protocols or exploit a specific vulnerability.
3. **High throughput**: The average throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 17296000 and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 26128000) are unusually high, indicating a potential data transfer or exfiltration activity.
4. **Unbalanced packet sizes**: The distribution of packet sizes (NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 14, NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES: 0, ..., NUM_PKTS_1024_TO_1514_BYTES: 2) suggests an attempt to evade detection or exploit specific network vulnerabilities.
5. **ICMP type**: The ICMP_TYPE value (35072) is not a commonly seen value and may indicate an attempt to use ICMP for malicious purposes.

**Additional Observations:**

* The source IP address (175.45.176.0) is from a known Internet Service Provider (ISP), which could be a legitimate user or a compromised system.
* The destination IP address (149.171.126.11) is not a well-known IP, and its reputation should be investigated further.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis of these features, I believe that this NetFlow data is malicious due to the presence of retransmitted packets, unusual protocol usage, high throughput, unbalanced packet sizes, and suspicious ICMP type. Further investigation is recommended to determine the nature of the activity and potential threats associated with it.
