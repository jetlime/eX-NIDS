This NetFlow sample is considered malicious due to several feature values that suggest anomalous and potentially malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious features:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 21**: The destination port is 21, which is typically used for FTP (File Transfer Protocol) services. However, the **FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE** value is 331.0, which is an unusual response code for FTP commands. This might indicate a potential FTP-related attack or exploitation.
2. **L7_PROTO: 1.0**: The L7 protocol version is 1.0, which is not a standard or commonly used value. This could be an indication of a custom or malicious application-layer protocol.
3. **TCP_FLAGS: 24** and **CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 24**: The TCP flags indicate that the packet has only the ACK (acknowledgment) flag set. This is unusual, as most TCP connections involve SYN (synchronize), ACK, and other flags. The client-side flags also show an ACK-only packet, which is suspicious.
4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0**: The flow duration is zero, indicating that the connection was very short-lived. This could be a sign of a scanning or probing attempt rather than a legitimate connection.
5. **SRC_TO_DST_SECOND_BYTES** and **DST_TO_SRC_SECOND_BYTES**: The byte rates (2432000 and 3312000) are unusually high for a single packet. This might indicate a data transfer or exfiltration activity.
6. **NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 11**: There are 11 packets with sizes up to 128 bytes, which is an unusual distribution of packet sizes.

Considering these features, the NetFlow sample appears to be malicious due to the following reasons:

* Unusual FTP-related activity (L4_DST_PORT and FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE)
* Suspicious L7 protocol version
* Anomalous TCP flags and flow duration
* High byte rates and unusual packet size distribution

These indicators suggest that this NetFlow sample might be related to a malicious activity, such as an FTP-based attack or data exfiltration. Further investigation is recommended to determine the nature of this activity and potential threats.
