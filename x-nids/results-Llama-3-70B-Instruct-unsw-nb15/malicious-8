Based on the NetFlow data provided, I'll explain why it's considered malicious and highlight specific feature values that support this analysis.

**Malicious Indicators:**

1. **Unusual Port Number:** The source port (L4_SRC_PORT) is 37218, which is not a commonly used port number for legitimate traffic. This could indicate an attempt to evade detection or exploit a vulnerability.
2. **Short Flow Duration:** The flow duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS) is 0, indicating that the connection was very short-lived. This might suggest a reconnaissance or probing attack rather than a legitimate communication.
3. **High Throughput:** The average throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT) are unusually high, suggesting a potential data exfiltration or DDoS attack.
4. **Retransmitted Packets:** There are retransmitted packets in both directions (RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES), which could indicate packet tampering or injection attacks.
5. **Lack of DNS Query Information:** The DNS query ID, type, and TTL answer are all 0, indicating that there was no legitimate DNS activity associated with this flow.

**Other Suspicious Features:**

1. **TCP Flags:** The TCP flags (TCP_FLAGS) are 19, which is an unusual combination of flags. This could indicate a non-standard or malicious use of TCP.
2. **Packet Length Distribution:** The distribution of packet lengths (MIN_IP_PKT_LEN to MAX_IP_PKT_LEN) is unusual, with a high number of packets in the 256-512 byte range.

**Conclusion:**

Based on these features, it's likely that this NetFlow data represents malicious activity, such as a reconnaissance attack, data exfiltration, or DDoS attack. The unusual port number, short flow duration, high throughput, retransmitted packets, and lack of DNS query information all contribute to the suspicion of malicious activity.
