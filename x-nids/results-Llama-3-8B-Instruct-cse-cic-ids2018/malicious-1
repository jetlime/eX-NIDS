Based on the provided NetFlow data, I have analyzed the features to determine why it is considered malicious. Here's a breakdown of the reasons:

1. **Unusual TCP flags**: The TCP_FLAGS value (219) indicates that the packet has both SYN and ACK flags set, which is unusual for a standard HTTP request. This could be an indication of a potential exploitation attempt.

2. **High throughput**: The average throughput values (1392000 and 3056000) are significantly higher than typical HTTP traffic. This could indicate a large file transfer or a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

3. **Lack of DNS queries**: The absence of DNS queries (DNS_QUERY_ID: 0, DNS_QUERY_TYPE: 0, DNS_TTL_ANSWER: 0) is unusual for an HTTP request. This suggests that the traffic may not be legitimate or is attempting to bypass normal DNS resolution mechanisms.

4. **FTP command response code**: The FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE value is set to 0, indicating no response from the server. This could indicate a potential exploitation attempt or a DoS attack.

5. **Unusual packet sizes**: The longest and shortest packet lengths (975 and 40) are significantly different, which may indicate a packet manipulation or fragmentation attack.

6. **High TTL values**: The minimum and maximum TTL values (127) are unusually high for HTTP traffic, suggesting that the traffic may be attempting to bypass normal network routing mechanisms.

7. **Unusual protocol usage**: The L7_PROTO value (7.0) is not a standard HTTP protocol version (1.0 or 1.1). This could indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in older HTTP versions.

Based on these features, I conclude that the NetFlow data is considered malicious due to its unusual behavior and potential attempts to bypass normal network mechanisms or exploit vulnerabilities.
