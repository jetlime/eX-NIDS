Based on the provided NetFlow data, I have analyzed the features to determine why this traffic is considered malicious. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious activities:

1. **Port Scan**: The L4_DST_PORT (80) indicates that the traffic is targeted at the HTTP port, which is commonly used for web browsing. However, the unusual aspect is that the attacker is scanning multiple ports on the same IP address (IPV4_DST_ADDR: 172.31.69.28) simultaneously. This behavior is suspicious because a legitimate client would typically only connect to one specific port.

2. **Abnormal TCP Flags**: The TCP_FLAGS value (219) indicates that the attacker has set several flags, including SYN, FIN, and RST. These flags are used for connection establishment, termination, and reset, respectively. However, in this case, it's unusual to see all three flags set simultaneously. This could be an indication of a scanning activity or attempting to exploit vulnerabilities.

3. **Large Packet Size**: The LONGEST_FOW_ PKT (975) indicates that the attacker has sent a large packet size, which is uncommon for typical web traffic. This could be an attempt to overwhelm the target system with large packets.

4. **Anomalous Flow Duration**: The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS value (4294935) is extremely high, indicating that the connection remained open for an unusually long time. Legitimate connections typically have much shorter durations.

5. **Unusual DNS Queries**: The DNS_QUERY_ID and DNS_QUERY_TYPE values are both 0, which suggests that no DNS queries were made during this session. This is unusual because DNS lookups are a common activity in web traffic.

6. **FTP Command Response Code**: The FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE value (0) indicates that there were no FTP command responses during the session. This is suspicious because FTP is often used for file transfers, which typically involve some level of interaction with the server.

Based on these features, it appears that this NetFlow data represents malicious activity, likely a port scan or vulnerability exploitation attempt. The unusual TCP flags, large packet size, and anomalous flow duration suggest that the attacker is attempting to exploit vulnerabilities or overwhelm the target system. The lack of DNS queries and FTP command responses further supports this conclusion.

It's essential to investigate these findings further by analyzing additional NetFlow data and other security logs to confirm the malicious activity and identify the potential source of the attack.
