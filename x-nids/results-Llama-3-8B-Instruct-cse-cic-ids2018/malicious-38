Based on the provided NetFlow data, I have analyzed the sample and identified it as malicious. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Unusual L4_DST_PORT**: The destination port (L4_DST_PORT) is set to 20000, which is an unusual port for normal network traffic. Typically, ports in the range of 1024-49151 are used by applications and services, while ports above 49152 are typically reserved for private use or experimental purposes.

2. **TCP_FLAGS**: The TCP flags (TCP_ FLAGS) indicate that the packet has both FIN (0x01) and ACK (0x10) bits set, which is unusual for a normal TCP connection. This could be indicative of an attempt to establish a connection using an unauthorized protocol or service.

3. **L7_PROTO**: The Layer 7 protocol (L7_PROTO) is set to 244.0, which is not a standard or well-known protocol. This suggests that the traffic may be attempting to communicate using an unknown or custom protocol, which could be malicious in nature.

4. **PROTOCOL**: The protocol field (PROTOCOL) is set to 6, which corresponds to TCP. However, the unusual L7_PROTO value and TCP flags suggest that this may not be a standard TCP connection.

5. **IN_BYTES** and **OUT_BYTES**: The input and output byte counts are relatively low (44 and 40 bytes, respectively), which could indicate a small payload or an attempt to hide malicious data within a legitimate-looking packet.

6. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN**: The maximum window size for incoming packets is set to 1024, which is an unusual value for normal network traffic. This could indicate that the attacker is trying to establish a connection using an unauthorized protocol or service.

Based on these features, I conclude that this NetFlow data is malicious and warrants further investigation.
