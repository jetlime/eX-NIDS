Based on the provided NetFlow data, I have identified several features that suggest this flow is malicious. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Destination Port**: The destination port is 22 (SSH), which is commonly used for remote access and file transfer. However, in this case, it's unusual to see an incoming connection on port 22 from an unknown IP address (13.58.98.64) to a known server (172.31.69.25).

2. **TCP Flags**: The TCP flags are set to 27 (SYN|ACK), which indicates that the flow is attempting to establish a new connection. This could be a sign of an attempted attack, such as a SYN flood or a brute-force attempt to access the server.

3. **L7 Protocol**: The L7 protocol is 92.0, which corresponds to the "unknown" or "unassigned" category in the IANA registry. This could indicate that the flow is attempting to hide its true nature or evade detection.

4. **Flow Duration**: The flow duration is 0 milliseconds, indicating that this flow is very short-lived and may be an attempt to quickly establish a connection before being detected.

5. **In/Out Bytes and Packets**: The in bytes (3180) and packets (23) are significantly higher than the out bytes (3869) and packets (23), which could indicate that the attacker is trying to send data or commands to the server, rather than just receiving information.

6. **TTL**: The MIN TTL (63) and MAX TTL (63) values suggest that the flow did not traverse any routers, which could be indicative of an internal attack or a man-in-the-middle (MitM) scenario.

7. **Packet Lengths**: The longest packet length (1028 bytes) is significantly larger than the shortest packet length (52 bytes), which may indicate that the attacker is sending large packets to overwhelm the server or hide malicious data.

8. **Throughput**: The average throughput values (25440000 and 30952000 bytes per second) are extremely high, which could be a sign of an attempt to quickly transfer data or exploit a vulnerability.

Based on these features, it's likely that this NetFlow data represents a malicious flow attempting to establish a connection with the server for nefarious purposes. Further analysis and investigation would be necessary to determine the specific type of attack and take appropriate action.
