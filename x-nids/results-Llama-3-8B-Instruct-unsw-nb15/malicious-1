Based on the provided NetFlow data, I have identified several features that indicate malicious activity. Here's a detailed explanation of why this traffic is considered malicious:

1. **Unusual L4 protocol and port numbers**: The L4 protocol (TCP) is used for most network communication, but the presence of an unusual port number (9979) on the source side and a well-known port number (179) on the destination side suggests potential exploitation or unauthorized access.

2. **High packet count and byte volume**: A high number of packets (10) and bytes (522) in the input direction indicates a significant amount of data being transmitted, which could be indicative of malware communication or data exfiltration.

3. **TCP flags and sequence numbers**: The presence of TCP flags (19) on both the client and server sides suggests that the traffic is not standard HTTP/S communication. This could indicate the use of custom protocols or encryption methods to evade detection.

4. **Retransmitted packets**: Although there are no retransmitted packets in the output direction, a single retransmitted packet in the input direction (RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1) may indicate that the connection is not stable or is experiencing issues, potentially indicating malicious activity.

5. **Unusual DNS query ID and type**: The absence of DNS query ID and type information (DNS_QUERY_ID: 0, DNS_QUERY_TYPE: 0) suggests that this traffic is not typical web browsing activity and may be related to malware communication or command-and-control (C2) traffic.

6. **ICMP type and IPv4 type**: The presence of an unusual ICMP type (21760) and IPv4 type (85) could indicate the use of custom protocols or evasion techniques to avoid detection by network security devices.

7. **FTP command return code**: The absence of FTP command return codes (FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE: 0.0) suggests that this traffic is not typical file transfer activity and may be related to malware communication or C2 traffic.

In conclusion, the presence of these unusual features in the NetFlow data indicates potential malicious activity, such as exploitation, unauthorized access, or malware communication. Further investigation and analysis are required to determine the specific nature of the threat.
