Based on the NetFlow data provided, I have analyzed the features and identified potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of my findings:

1. **Unusual protocol usage**: The protocol used is TCP (Protocol: 6), which is unusual for an attack. Typically, attacks use UDP or other protocols.
2. **High L4_SRC_PORT**: The source port (L4_SRC_PORT: 56258) is high and not commonly used by legitimate applications. This could indicate an attempt to obscure the origin of the traffic.
3. **Uncommon L4_DST_PORT**: The destination port (L4_DST_PORT: 111) is a reserved port for NFS (Network File System). While NFS can be used legitimately, it's uncommon for attacks to target this specific port.
4. **High IN_BYTES and OUT_BYTES**: The amount of data transferred (552 bytes in and 336 bytes out) is relatively high compared to typical network traffic. This could indicate an attempt to transfer a large payload or exploit a vulnerability.
5. **TCP_FLAGS**: The TCP flags (TCP_FLAGS: 19, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 19, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19) are set to FIN and PUSH. These flags can be used to manipulate the connection and potentially exploit vulnerabilities.

Based on these features, I believe this NetFlow data is likely malicious due to:

1. Unusual protocol usage (TCP)
2. High L4_SRC_PORT
3. Uncommon L4_DST_PORT
4. High IN_BYTES and OUT_BYTES
5. Suspicious TCP flags

This traffic pattern could be indicative of an attempt to exploit a vulnerability or transfer malware. Further analysis, such as examining the DNS queries, FTP commands, or ICMP types, may provide additional evidence supporting this assessment.

Please note that this is only a preliminary analysis based on the provided NetFlow data. A more comprehensive examination of the network traffic and other security-related information would be necessary to confirm the malicious nature of this activity.
