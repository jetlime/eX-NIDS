Based on the provided NetFlow data, I've analyzed the features to determine why it's considered malicious.

The protocol used is UDP (PROTOCOL: 17), which is a non-TCP/IP protocol commonly used for DNS queries or other types of traffic that don't require reliable communication. However, in this case, it's likely being used for malicious purposes.

The source and destination ports are 1043 (L4_SRC_PORT) and 53 (L4_DST_PORT), respectively. Port 53 is typically associated with DNS traffic, but the use of a non-standard port (1043) raises suspicions.

The IN_BYTES value is 114, indicating that data was received from the source IP address (175.45.176.3). The OUT_BYTES and OUT_ PKTS values are both 0, suggesting that no data was sent to the destination IP address (149.171.126.18).

The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS value is 0, indicating that the flow duration is unknown or not applicable.

The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS all have a value of 0, which suggests that this traffic does not involve TCP connections.

The presence of DNS-related features such as DNS_QUERY_ID (2262), DNS_QUERY_TYPE (255), and DNS_TTL_ANSWER (0) further supports the assumption that this traffic is related to DNS queries. However, the fact that it's using a non-standard port and has an unusual protocol (UDP) suggests that this traffic may be malicious.

The high value of SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT (912000) could indicate a potential amplification attack or a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

In conclusion, based on the features provided in the NetFlow data, I believe this traffic is considered malicious due to its use of a non-standard port and UDP protocol for DNS-related traffic. The high throughput value also raises concerns about potential amplification or DoS attacks. Further analysis would be necessary to confirm the exact nature of the malicious activity.
