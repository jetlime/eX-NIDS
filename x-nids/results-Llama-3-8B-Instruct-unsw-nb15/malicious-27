The Network Intrusion Detection System has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to several suspicious features present in the sample.

Firstly, the protocol used is TCP (Protocol: 6), which is unusual for a connection to a mail server (L4_DST_PORT: 25) as most email communications use SMTP over port 25. This could be an indication of malware or unauthorized activity on the network.

Secondly, the source IP address (IPV4_SRC_ADDR: 175.45.176.0) is not typical for legitimate email traffic, which usually originates from a client's IP address. This could indicate that the connection is being initiated by a malicious entity.

Thirdly, the TCP flags (TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19) suggest that the connection has been established using a non-standard or unusual method. Specifically, the SYN flag is set, indicating that the connection was initiated as a request from the client to the server. However, the FIN flag is also set, which is typically only used for closing a connection. This could indicate that the connection is being manipulated or hijacked by an attacker.

Fourthly, the packet size distribution (MIN_IP_PKT_LEN: 40, MAX_IP_PKT_LEN: 1500) and the number of packets with lengths above 1024 bytes (NUM_PKTS_1024_TO_1514_BYTES: 126) are unusual for legitimate email traffic. This could indicate that the attacker is using a large payload to send malicious data.

Lastly, the average throughput from source to destination (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 91848000) and the number of packets retransmitted due to errors (RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 78) are unusually high for a single connection. This could indicate that the attacker is using this connection to send large amounts of data or to bypass security controls.

In conclusion, while some of these features may be innocuous on their own, when taken together, they suggest that this NetFlow sample may be malicious in nature. The unusual protocol usage, IP address, TCP flags, packet size distribution, and throughput metrics all contribute to a suspicious profile that warrants further investigation.
