Based on the provided NetFlow data, I have analyzed the features to determine why it is considered malicious.

The protocol used in this communication is UDP (PROTOCOL=17), which is a common protocol used for malicious activities such as spreading malware or conducting DDoS attacks. Additionally, the L4_DST_PORT=514 is typically associated with the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), but it can also be used for malicious purposes.

The IN_BYTES=956 and IN_PKTS=2 indicate that a relatively small amount of data was sent from the source IP address 175.45.176.1 to the destination IP address 149.171.126.18, which is unusual for legitimate network communication. The OUT_BYTES=0 and OUT_PKTS=0 suggest that no data was sent in response, indicating a one-way communication.

The TCP_FLAGS=0, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS=0, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS=0 indicate that the connection did not use any of the standard TCP flags (e.g., SYN, ACK, FIN) for establishing or closing a connection. This is unusual for legitimate network communication and may indicate an attempt to bypass normal security controls.

The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS=0, DURATION_IN=0, DURATION_OUT=0 suggest that this flow was very short-lived, which can be indicative of a malicious activity.

In conclusion, based on the features present in the NetFlow sample, I have determined that this communication is considered malicious due to the use of UDP protocol, unusual packet and byte counts, lack of standard TCP flags, and short-lived nature of the connection.
