The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to several suspicious characteristics present in the sample. Here's a breakdown of why it is considered malicious:

1. **Unusual source port**: The L4_SRC_PORT value of 8007 is not a typical port for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), which usually uses port 25. This suggests that the traffic may be using a non-standard or encrypted protocol.
2. **Large amount of data transferred in a short duration**: The IN_BYTES and OUT_BYTES values are 16980 and 1842, respectively, indicating a significant amount of data was transferred in a short duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS is 0). This could be an indication of a data exfiltration attempt.
3. **Retransmitted packets**: The RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES values are non-zero, indicating that some packets were retransmitted. This could be an indication of packet loss or corruption during transmission, which is unusual for a legitimate SMTP session.
4. **Unusual TCP flags**: The TCP_FLAGS value of 27 indicates that the SYN and FIN flags were set, which is not typical for a standard SMTP connection. This suggests that the traffic may be using an unauthorized protocol or attempting to establish a connection without completing it.
5. **No DNS queries or FTP commands**: The absence of DNS_QUERY_ID, DNS_QUERY_TYPE, DNS_TTL_ANSWER, FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE values indicates that no DNS queries or FTP commands were made during the flow, which is unusual for a legitimate SMTP session.

Based on these features, it is likely that this NetFlow data represents malicious traffic. The unusual source port, large amount of data transferred in a short duration, retransmitted packets, and unusual TCP flags all suggest that the traffic may be attempting to exfiltrate data or establish an unauthorized connection.
