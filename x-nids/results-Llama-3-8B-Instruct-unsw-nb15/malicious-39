Based on the provided NetFlow data, I have identified several features that indicate this traffic is malicious:

1. **No L4_SRC_PORT and L4_DST_PORT values**: The source and destination port numbers are set to 0, which is unusual for normal network traffic. This lack of port information makes it difficult to determine the purpose or application behind the communication.
2. **Protocol 135 (NetBIOS)**: NetBIOS is an old protocol that was largely replaced by newer protocols like TCP/IP. Its presence in modern networks often indicates malicious activity, such as worms or viruses trying to exploit vulnerabilities.
3. **No L7_PROTO value**: The lack of a Layer 7 protocol (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP) suggests that the traffic is not related to typical network applications. This could indicate an attempt to hide the true nature of the communication.
4. **IN_BYTES: 200 and IN_PKTS: 2**: The small number of packets and bytes received indicates a potential scan or reconnaissance activity rather than legitimate data transfer.
5. **OUT_BYTES: 0 and OUT_PKTS: 0**: The absence of any output traffic suggests that the system is not responding to the incoming traffic, which could indicate an attack or exploitation attempt.

Based on these features, I consider this NetFlow data malicious due to its unusual patterns, lack of port information, and potential attempts to hide the true nature of the communication. Further analysis would be necessary to determine the specific type of attack or malware involved.
