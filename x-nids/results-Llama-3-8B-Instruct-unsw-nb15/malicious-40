Based on the NetFlow data, I have analyzed the features to determine why this traffic is considered malicious.

The IP addresses involved are:

* IPV4_SRC_ADDR: 175.45.176.2 (the source IP address)
* IPV4_DST_ADDR: 149.171.126.17 (the destination IP address)

The protocol used is TCP (PROTOCOL: 6), which is a common protocol for malicious activity.

The destination port is 25, which is the standard SMTP port for sending emails. However, the fact that the source port is not the typical SMTP port (e.g., 2525) and the L7_PROTO value is 0.0 suggests that this traffic may be attempting to send spam or malware using a different protocol.

The TCP flags are:

* CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27
* SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19

The presence of these flags indicates that the client (175.45.176.2) initiated a connection and sent data, while the server (149.171.126.17) responded with an acknowledgment (ACK) and requested data. This suggests that this traffic is attempting to establish a command-and-control (C2) communication channel.

The IN_BYTES value is 23866, which is a relatively large amount of incoming data. The OUT_BYTES value is 1756, which is smaller but still significant. The TCP_WIN_MAX_IN and TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT values are both set to 16383, indicating that the client is attempting to send a large amount of data.

The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS value is 0, indicating that this flow has not been active for any extended period. However, the IN_PKTS value is 36, and the OUT_PKTS value is 22, suggesting that this traffic may be attempting to establish a persistent connection.

The RETRANSMITTED_ fields indicate that the client retransmitted some data (11757 bytes) before the server responded. This could be an indication of packet loss or corruption during transmission.

In summary, based on these features, I believe that this traffic is considered malicious because it:

* Uses a non-standard protocol and destination port
* Initiates a connection with unusual TCP flags
* Sends a large amount of incoming data
* Attempts to establish a persistent connection
* Retransmits data before the server responds

These characteristics are often associated with command-and-control (C2) communication channels, which are commonly used by malware for communication and control.
