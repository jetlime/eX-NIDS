Based on the NetFlow data provided, I've analyzed it to determine why it's considered malicious.

The primary reason this traffic is flagged as malicious is due to its similarity to a known Command and Control (C2) communication pattern. Here are some specific features that support this conclusion:

1. **Destination Port 25**: This indicates that the traffic is destined for a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server, which is commonly used by email servers. However, in this case, it's unusual to see a connection to an SMTP server from an unknown source.
2. **TCP Flags: 27**: The TCP flags indicate that the SYN flag (0x02) and FIN flag (0x01) are set, suggesting that this is a connection initiation attempt followed by a premature termination. This is unusual behavior for legitimate traffic.
3. **Server TCP Flags: 19**: The server-side TCP flags show that only the ACK flag (0x10) is set, which is typical for an SMTP server responding to a client's request. However, in this case, it's unusual to see such a limited set of flags from a server.
4. **Flow Duration Milliseconds: 0**: The flow duration is extremely short, indicating that the connection was quickly terminated after being initiated. This behavior is consistent with C2 communication patterns.
5. **Retransmitted Packets and Bytes**: There are retransmitted packets and bytes, which suggests that there were issues with the initial transmission, such as packet loss or corruption. This could be indicative of a malicious actor attempting to establish a connection.

Based on these features, it's likely that this traffic is part of a C2 communication pattern, potentially used for command injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The Network Intrusion Detection System has flagged this traffic as malicious due to its unusual behavior and potential threat to the network's security.
