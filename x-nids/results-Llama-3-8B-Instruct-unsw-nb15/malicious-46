The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to several suspicious features and values present in the sample. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Unusual source port**: The L4_SRC_PORT value is 61083, which is an unusual port for normal traffic. Typically, ports used by legitimate applications are well-known (e.g., 80 for HTTP) or registered (e.g., 443 for HTTPS). This could indicate a malware or unauthorized application attempting to communicate with the destination.
2. **TCP flags**: The TCP_FLAGS value is 27, which indicates that the SYN and FIN flags were set simultaneously. This is unusual, as legitimate TCP connections typically use one of these flags at a time (e.g., SYN for initial connection establishment). This could be an indication of a Trojan or malware attempting to establish a connection.
3. **Large number of retransmitted packets**: The RETRANSMITTED_IN_Bytes and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_Bytes values are 905 and 1505, respectively, which is an unusually large amount of data being retransmitted. This could indicate network congestion or packet loss due to malicious activity.
4. **Unusual protocol and L7 protocol**: The PROTOCOL value is 6 (TCP), but the L7_PROTO value is 7.0, which is not a standard protocol. This could indicate an attempt to tunnel or encrypt traffic using an unknown protocol.
5. **Large packet sizes**: The LONGEST_FLOW_PKT and MAX_IP_PKT_LEN values are 1091 and 1091 bytes, respectively, which is unusually large for normal network traffic. This could be indicative of a data exfiltration attempt or a malware attempting to send a large payload.

Based on these features and values, the NIDS has flagged this NetFlow data as malicious due to its unusual and suspicious characteristics, which may indicate an attempted intrusion or malicious activity.
