Based on the provided NetFlow data, I have analyzed the features to identify potential malicious activity.

The flagged NetFlow data exhibits several characteristics that indicate a possible malicious connection:

1. **TCP Port 21**: The destination port (L4_DST_PORT) is 21, which is typically used for FTP (File Transfer Protocol). However, this port is often targeted by malware and hackers for unauthorized file transfer or command execution.
2. **Small IN_Bytes and OUT_Bytes**: The input bytes (IN_BYTES) are only 9, and output bytes (OUT_BYTES) are 108. This unusual packet size could indicate a Trojan or malware attempting to communicate with its C2 server.
3. **TCP Flags**: The TCP flags (TCP_FLAGS) have the value 24, which corresponds to the SYN flag being set. This suggests that the connection is in the initial handshake phase, which is common for malicious connections trying to establish a connection with a command and control (C2) server.
4. **No DNS Query or FTP Command**: There are no DNS queries (DNS_QUERY_ID) or FTP commands (FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE) present in this NetFlow data, which is unusual for a legitimate FTP session.

Considering these features, it appears that the flagged NetFlow data may be related to a potential malicious activity, such as:

* A Trojan or malware attempting to communicate with its C2 server using TCP port 21.
* A reconnaissance scan or scanning activity aiming to identify vulnerable systems.

To further investigate this incident, I recommend analyzing additional NetFlow data and system logs for any other suspicious connections or activities. Additionally, reviewing the system's security event logs and monitoring for potential lateral movement or exploitation may provide more insight into the malicious activity.
