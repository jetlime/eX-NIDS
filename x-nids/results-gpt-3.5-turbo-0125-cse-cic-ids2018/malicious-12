This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. Unusual Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol:
- PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP) is commonly used for legitimate web traffic, but the L7_PROTO value of 7.0 is not a standard protocol identifier. This discrepancy suggests potential protocol manipulation or obfuscation.

2. Abnormal Flow Characteristics:
- The flow duration of 4294763 milliseconds (approximately 71 minutes) is unusually long for a typical web session, indicating a prolonged connection that may be part of a malicious activity.

3. Unusual Packet and Byte Counts:
- The disparity between the number of incoming packets (22) and outgoing packets (20) along with the significant difference in incoming (2855 bytes) and outgoing (4812 bytes) traffic suggests asymmetric communication patterns, which can be indicative of data exfiltration or command-and-control activities.

4. Suspicious TCP Flags:
- The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS values of 27 indicate the presence of multiple TCP flags set in the packet headers, which could be an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or evade detection.

5. Anomalous Network Behavior:
- The presence of retransmitted incoming bytes (431) and packets (1) without corresponding retransmitted outgoing bytes or packets suggests potential data retransmission anomalies, which can be associated with network scanning or reconnaissance activities.

6. Uncommon ICMP Type and DNS Attributes:
- The ICMP_TYPE value of 44800 and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE value of 175 are not standard ICMP types, indicating potential ICMP-based attacks. Additionally, the DNS-related attributes (DNS_QUERY_ID, DNS_QUERY_TYPE, DNS_TTL_ANSWER) being set to 0 may suggest attempts to hide DNS-related activities.

7. Suspicious Throughput and Packet Size Distribution:
- The high average throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 104000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 184000) and the distribution of packet sizes across different ranges (e.g., NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES, NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES) may indicate abnormal data transfer patterns associated with malicious activities.

In conclusion, the combination of these anomalous feature values in the NetFlow data sample suggests potential malicious intent, such as network scanning, data exfiltration, or reconnaissance activities. Further investigation and mitigation actions are recommended to address this security threat.
