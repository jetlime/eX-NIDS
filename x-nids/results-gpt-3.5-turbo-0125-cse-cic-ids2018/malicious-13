Based on the provided NetFlow data, the flagged traffic is considered malicious due to several suspicious characteristics:

1. **Unusual Protocol Usage**:
   - The value of L7_PROTO (Layer 7 Protocol) being 7.0 is uncommon and may indicate the use of an unknown or potentially malicious application layer protocol.

2. **High Throughput**:
   - The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT values are significantly high (136000 and 272000, respectively), suggesting a potentially abnormal amount of data transfer between the source and destination.

3. **TCP Flags**:
   - The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS all having a value of 27 may indicate abnormal TCP flag combinations that could be associated with malicious activities like port scanning or data exfiltration.

4. **Unusual Packet Lengths**:
   - The range of packet lengths (MIN_IP_PKT_LEN and MAX_IP_PKT_LEN) from 52 to 987 bytes is broad and could be indicative of abnormal packet fragmentation or data manipulation.

5. **Retransmission**:
   - The presence of RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS values (987 and 1, respectively) suggests potential data retransmission, which can be a sign of network scanning or reconnaissance.

6. **Abnormal Flow Duration**:
   - The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS value of 4294655 milliseconds is relatively long, indicating a prolonged connection that may be part of a malicious activity like a DDoS attack or data exfiltration.

7. **Unusual Packet Distribution**:
   - The distribution of packet sizes across different ranges (NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES, NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES, etc.) may not align with typical network traffic patterns, raising suspicion.

8. **TCP Window Size**:
   - The TCP_WIN_MAX_IN and TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT values being 26883 and 26847, respectively, are relatively high and could be indicative of abnormal TCP window scaling.

Considering these factors collectively, the NetFlow data exhibits multiple characteristics commonly associated with malicious network activities, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation actions.
