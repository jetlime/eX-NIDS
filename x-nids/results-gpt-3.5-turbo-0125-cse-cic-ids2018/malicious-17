This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. Unusual Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol:
   - PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP) and L7_PROTO: 7.0 (Unknown/Unsupported Protocol) combination is unusual and could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual protocol being used.

2. Abnormal Traffic Patterns:
   - IN_BYTES: 3119, OUT_BYTES: 6015, IN_PKTS: 25, OUT_PKTS: 25 show a significant difference in traffic volume between incoming and outgoing packets, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or a potential attack.

3. TCP Flags and Retransmission:
   - TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27 suggest abnormal TCP flag combinations that could be used for malicious purposes.
   - RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 1974, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 2 indicate retransmission of data, which could be a sign of network scanning or reconnaissance activities.

4. Unusual Flow Duration:
   - FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294654, DURATION_IN: 313, DURATION_OUT: 313 show a long overall flow duration with short individual durations, which is atypical and could be an attempt to evade detection.

5. Uncommon Packet Lengths:
   - MIN_IP_PKT_LEN: 52, MAX_IP_PKT_LEN: 987, LONGEST_FLOW_PKT: 987, SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT: 52 suggest a wide range of packet lengths, which could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in network devices.

6. Suspicious Throughput:
   - SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 72000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 152000 show high average throughput values, which could be an indication of a potential DDoS attack or data exfiltration.

Based on these indicators, the NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to the presence of multiple anomalous characteristics that collectively suggest potentially harmful network activity.
