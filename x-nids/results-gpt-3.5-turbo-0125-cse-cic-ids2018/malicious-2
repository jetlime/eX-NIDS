Based on the provided NetFlow data, the flagged traffic is considered malicious due to several suspicious characteristics:

1. **Unusual Protocol (L7_PROTO: 7.0)**: The Layer 7 protocol value of 7.0 is not a standard protocol and could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual protocol being used.

2. **High Throughput**: The average throughput from source to destination (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 112000) and from destination to source (DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 216000) is unusually high, which could be indicative of a potential DDoS attack or data exfiltration.

3. **Unusual TCP Flags (TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27)**: The TCP flags being set to 27 are uncommon and could suggest an attempt to manipulate the TCP connection in a malicious way.

4. **Unusual Flow Duration**: The flow duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294795) is relatively long, which could be an indication of a prolonged attack or data transfer.

5. **Unusual Packet Lengths**: The range of packet lengths (MIN_IP_PKT_LEN: 52, MAX_IP_PKT_LEN: 987) is wide, which could be an attempt to evade detection by varying packet sizes.

6. **Unusual TTL Values (MIN_TTL: 63, MAX_TTL: 63)**: The Time-to-Live (TTL) values being consistent at 63 could indicate an attempt to hide the true source of the traffic.

7. **Unusual Number of Packets**: The distribution of packet sizes (NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 34, NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES: 4, NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES: 4) is skewed towards smaller packets, which could be an attempt to evade detection mechanisms.

8. **High Retransmission Rate**: The absence of retransmitted packets (RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 0, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 0) despite the high throughput could indicate a potential evasion technique or a well-crafted attack.

Considering these factors collectively, the NetFlow data exhibits several anomalies and characteristics commonly associated with malicious traffic, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation actions.
