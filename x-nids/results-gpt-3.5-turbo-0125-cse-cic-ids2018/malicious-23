Based on the provided NetFlow data, the flagged traffic is considered malicious due to several suspicious characteristics:

1. **Unusual Traffic Patterns**:
   - The flow duration is relatively long at 4294530 milliseconds (about 71 minutes), which is uncommon for regular user traffic.
   - The number of packets and bytes transferred in both directions is disproportionate, with significantly more outbound bytes (1136) compared to inbound bytes (232).
   - The average throughput from the destination to the source (DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT) is unusually high at 9088000 bytes per second, indicating potentially malicious data exfiltration.

2. **TCP Flags**:
   - The TCP flags values are suspiciously high, with a total TCP flags value of 223, client TCP flags of 222, and server TCP flags of 27. Such high flag values could indicate abnormal TCP behavior or attempts to evade detection.

3. **Packet Lengths**:
   - The range of packet lengths is also unusual, with a significant difference between the shortest (40 bytes) and longest (1004 bytes) flow packets. This could be an indication of data fragmentation or manipulation.

4. **TTL Values**:
   - The minimum and maximum TTL values are both 127, which is not typical for regular network traffic. Consistent TTL values could suggest artificial traffic generation or spoofing.

5. **Retransmission**:
   - The absence of retransmitted bytes and packets could be suspicious, as legitimate connections often involve some level of retransmission for error recovery.

6. **DNS and FTP Activity**:
   - The DNS query ID, type, and TTL answer values are all 0, indicating a lack of meaningful DNS activity associated with the flow. Similarly, the FTP command return code is 0, suggesting no legitimate FTP activity.

In conclusion, the combination of these features in the NetFlow data sample suggests potential malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, evasion techniques, or abnormal network behavior. The Network Intrusion Detection System flagged this traffic as malicious to prompt further investigation and potential mitigation actions.
