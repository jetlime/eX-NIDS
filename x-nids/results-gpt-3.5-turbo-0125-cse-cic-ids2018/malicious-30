This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here is an analysis of the specific feature values that support this conclusion:

1. Unusual Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol:
- The PROTOCOL value is 6, indicating TCP traffic.
- The L7_PROTO value is 7.0, which is an unusual or unknown Layer 7 protocol.
- The combination of a standard transport protocol (TCP) with an unknown Layer 7 protocol can be indicative of obfuscation or malicious activity.

2. Abnormal Traffic Patterns:
- The flow duration is 4294920 milliseconds (approximately 71 minutes), which is relatively long for a single flow.
- The number of packets and bytes transferred in both directions is asymmetric, with more OUT_BYTES (2406) than IN_BYTES (1247).
- The throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT) are unusually high at 200000 and 400000, respectively.
- These patterns suggest potential data exfiltration or communication with a command and control server.

3. Uncommon TCP Flags:
- The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS are all set to 27, which is not a standard combination of TCP flags.
- This could indicate an attempt to evade detection by using non-standard flag combinations.

4. Unusual Packet Lengths:
- The MIN_IP_PKT_LEN and MAX_IP_PKT_LEN values are 52 and 987, respectively, which represent a wide range of packet sizes.
- This variability in packet lengths could be indicative of a scanning or reconnaissance activity.

5. Lack of Retransmitted Packets:
- The absence of any retransmitted packets (RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS are both 0) is uncommon in typical network traffic.
- Malicious actors may intentionally avoid retransmissions to avoid detection mechanisms.

Based on these observations, the combination of unusual protocol behavior, abnormal traffic patterns, uncommon TCP flags, unusual packet lengths, and lack of retransmitted packets collectively suggest that the NetFlow data represents potentially malicious activity that warrants further investigation and mitigation.
