This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here's an analysis of the specific feature values that support this conclusion:

1. **Unusual Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol**:
   - The PROTOCOL value of 6 indicates TCP, which is commonly used for legitimate web traffic. However, the L7_PROTO value of 7.0 is unusual and does not correspond to any standard application layer protocol. This discrepancy suggests potential obfuscation or malicious intent.

2. **High Volume of Outbound Traffic**:
   - The OUT_BYTES value of 2406 is significantly higher than the IN_BYTES value of 1255, indicating a high volume of outbound traffic relative to inbound traffic. This asymmetry could be indicative of data exfiltration or a command-and-control communication pattern.

3. **Abnormal Flow Duration**:
   - The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS value of 4294795 milliseconds (approximately 71 minutes) is relatively long for a single flow. Such extended durations are atypical for regular user interactions and may point to a prolonged data transfer or communication session associated with malicious activities.

4. **Identical TCP Flags**:
   - The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS all having a value of 27 suggest that the same set of TCP flags (ACK, FIN, PSH) were consistently set throughout the communication. This behavior could be indicative of a specific attack pattern or evasion technique.

5. **Unusual Throughput Values**:
   - The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT values of 56000 and 64000, respectively, are unusually high and may indicate aggressive data transfer rates that are not typical for regular user traffic.

6. **Limited Packet Size Distribution**:
   - The distribution of packet sizes, as indicated by the NUM_PKTS_*_BYTES fields, shows a limited range of packet sizes with a higher concentration in the smaller size categories. This pattern could be consistent with certain types of scanning or reconnaissance activities.

7. **Zero Retransmitted Packets or Bytes**:
   - The absence of any retransmitted packets or bytes (RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS all being 0) is unusual in network communications and may suggest an attempt to avoid detection by not retransmitting data.

In summary, the combination of these features in the NetFlow data sample raises red flags and indicates potentially malicious behavior, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation actions by the Network Intrusion Detection System.
