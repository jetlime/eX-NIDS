This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here is an analysis of the specific feature values that support this conclusion:

1. Unusual Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol:
- PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP) indicates a standard TCP connection.
- L7_PROTO: 7.0 is an uncommon Layer 7 protocol value, which could be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate the actual application or protocol being used.

2. Abnormal Traffic Patterns:
- IN_BYTES: 473 and OUT_BYTES: 1147 show a significant difference in incoming and outgoing traffic volume, which could suggest data exfiltration or a potential data breach.
- SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 112000 and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 280000 indicate high throughput rates, which may be abnormal for the observed communication.

3. Unusual TCP Flags:
- TCP_FLAGS: 219, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 219, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27 show a combination of TCP flags that are not typical for regular communication patterns. This could indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or perform malicious activities.

4. Suspicious Flow Duration:
- FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294936 and DURATION_IN: 31, DURATION_OUT: 31 show a long flow duration compared to the small number of packets exchanged, which could be a sign of a slow data exfiltration attempt or a stealthy communication channel.

5. Uncommon Packet Lengths:
- MIN_IP_PKT_LEN: 40 and MAX_IP_PKT_LEN: 975 show a wide range of packet lengths, which could be indicative of abnormal packet fragmentation or manipulation.

Based on these observations, the combination of unusual protocol values, abnormal traffic patterns, suspicious TCP flags, long flow duration, and uncommon packet lengths suggest that this NetFlow data is potentially malicious and warrants further investigation or mitigation actions.
