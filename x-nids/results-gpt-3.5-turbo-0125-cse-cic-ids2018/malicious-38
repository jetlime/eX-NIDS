This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Let's analyze the specific feature values to support this conclusion:

1. **Unusual Protocol (L7_PROTO: 244.0):** The Layer 7 protocol value of 244.0 is not a standard protocol and is often used to obfuscate malicious traffic.

2. **TCP Flags (TCP_FLAGS: 22, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 2, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 20):** The combination of TCP flags indicates abnormal behavior. The TCP_FLAGS value of 22 suggests the presence of both SYN and ACK flags set, which is unusual for a regular TCP connection. Additionally, the distribution of flags between client and server is asymmetric (CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 2, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 20), which is suspicious.

3. **Flow Duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, DURATION_OUT):** The flow duration values being all zero indicate a very short-lived connection, which is often associated with malicious activities like port scanning or reconnaissance.

4. **Low Packet Counts and Bytes (IN_BYTES: 44, IN_PKTS: 1, OUT_BYTES: 40, OUT_PKTS: 1):** The low number of packets and bytes exchanged in this flow is atypical for legitimate network traffic and could be an attempt to evade detection.

5. **Abnormal Throughput (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 352000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 320000):** The high average throughput values are suspicious for a connection with such low data transfer amounts, indicating potential data exfiltration or other malicious activities.

6. **Unusual Packet Lengths (MIN_IP_PKT_LEN: 40, MAX_IP_PKT_LEN: 44, LONGEST_FLOW_PKT: 44, SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT: 40):** The consistent packet lengths and the range being very close together suggest a pattern that is not typical for regular network traffic.

Based on these observations, the combination of unusual protocol, TCP flags, short flow duration, low packet counts, abnormal throughput, and packet lengths all point towards the NetFlow data being part of a malicious network activity.
