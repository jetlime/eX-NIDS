This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to the following reasons:

1. Unusual Port Combination: The source port (65356) is a high-numbered port, which is typically used for ephemeral connections, while the destination port (53) is commonly associated with DNS traffic. This combination is suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to bypass security measures by using a non-standard port for communication.

2. Protocol Mismatch: The protocol field indicates UDP (17), which is commonly used for DNS traffic. However, the Layer 7 protocol field (L7_PROTO) is marked as 0.0, which is unusual and may suggest an attempt to obfuscate the actual application protocol being used.

3. Short Duration and Low Packet Count: The flow duration is recorded as 0 milliseconds, with only 1 packet in each direction. This indicates a very short-lived communication session, which is often associated with malicious activities such as reconnaissance or quick data exfiltration.

4. Abnormal Throughput: The average throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT) are unusually high (584000 and 712000, respectively), which may indicate a data transfer operation that is attempting to quickly transmit a significant amount of data.

5. DNS Query with Short TTL: The DNS query included in the flow has a low TTL answer of 60 seconds, which is atypical for legitimate DNS queries. This behavior could be indicative of a DNS tunneling attack or malicious domain resolution.

In summary, the combination of high-numbered source port, unusual protocol behavior, short duration, abnormal throughput, and suspicious DNS query characteristics collectively suggest that the NetFlow data represents potentially malicious activity that warrants further investigation and mitigation.
