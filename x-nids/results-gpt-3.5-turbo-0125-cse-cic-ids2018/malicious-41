This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here is an analysis of the specific feature values that support this conclusion:

1. **Unusual Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol**:
   - The PROTOCOL value of 6 indicates TCP, which is commonly used for legitimate web traffic. However, the L7_PROTO value of 7.0 does not correspond to any standard application layer protocol. This discrepancy suggests potential obfuscation or non-standard behavior.

2. **Abnormal Traffic Patterns**:
   - The flow duration of 4294905 milliseconds (approximately 71 minutes) is unusually long for a single connection to a web server on port 80. This extended duration may indicate a prolonged attempt to establish unauthorized access or exfiltrate data.

3. **TCP Flags**:
   - The TCP_FLAGS value of 223 and the separate CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS values suggest manipulation or irregularities in the TCP handshake process. Such behavior can be indicative of attempts to evade detection mechanisms or exploit vulnerabilities.

4. **Throughput Discrepancies**:
   - The significantly higher average throughput from the destination to the source (DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 9088000) compared to the source to destination (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 1536000) is atypical for typical client-server communication patterns. This imbalance could be a sign of data exfiltration or a covert channel.

5. **Packet Size Distribution**:
   - The distribution of packet sizes, with a high number of packets in the range of 40 to 128 bytes and only one packet in the range of 512 to 1024 bytes, is unusual for regular web traffic. This pattern may indicate attempts to avoid detection by sending small, fragmented packets.

6. **TTL Values**:
   - The consistent minimum and maximum TTL values of 127 suggest that the traffic may be attempting to hide its origin by setting a fixed TTL value. This behavior is often associated with malicious activities seeking to obscure the true source of the traffic.

In summary, the combination of these anomalous feature values in the NetFlow data sample raises red flags and indicates potential malicious intent behind the observed network activity. Further investigation and mitigation actions are recommended to address this suspicious traffic.
