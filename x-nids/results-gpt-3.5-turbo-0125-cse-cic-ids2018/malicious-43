The provided NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to several suspicious characteristics that indicate potential malicious activity. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Protocol (L7_PROTO: 92.0):** The Layer 7 protocol value of 92.0 is not a standard protocol and could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual protocol being used.

2. **High Throughput (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 25440000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 30952000):** The average throughput values are unusually high, which could suggest a potential denial of service (DoS) attack or data exfiltration.

3. **TCP Flags (TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27):** The TCP flags are set to 27, which is not a standard combination and could indicate an attempt to bypass normal TCP handshake procedures.

4. **Zero Flow Duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0):** The flow duration values are all zero, which is uncommon for legitimate network traffic and could indicate a short-lived or malicious connection.

5. **Unusual Packet Sizes (LONGEST_FLOW_PKT: 1028, SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT: 52, MIN_IP_PKT_LEN: 52, MAX_IP_PKT_LEN: 1028):** The range of packet sizes is wide, with a short packet size of 52 bytes and a long packet size of 1028 bytes, which could be indicative of abnormal packet fragmentation or data manipulation.

6. **High Number of Small Packets (NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 35, NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES: 7):** The distribution of packet sizes skewed towards smaller packets could be a sign of a scanning or reconnaissance activity.

7. **Unusual TCP Window Sizes (TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 26883, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 26847):** The TCP window sizes are relatively high, which could be an attempt to overwhelm the receiving end with excessive data.

Based on these features, the NetFlow data is likely considered malicious due to the combination of unusual protocol values, high throughput, abnormal TCP flags, zero flow duration, unusual packet sizes, high number of small packets, and unusual TCP window sizes. These characteristics collectively suggest potentially malicious intent or abnormal network behavior that warrants further investigation and mitigation.
