This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. Unusual Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol:
- PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP) indicates a standard transport protocol.
- L7_PROTO: 7.0 is an uncommon Layer 7 protocol value, which could be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate the actual application layer protocol.

2. Unusual Flow Characteristics:
- TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS all set to 27, which is not a standard combination and could indicate abnormal behavior.
- Flow duration of 4294717 milliseconds is relatively long and may suggest a prolonged connection for malicious purposes.

3. Suspicious Traffic Patterns:
- IN_BYTES: 4088 and OUT_BYTES: 6015 show a significant amount of data transferred.
- RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 827 and RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 2 suggest retransmission of data, which can be a sign of malicious activity like data exfiltration or evasion techniques.

4. Abnormal Packet Sizes:
- LONGEST_FLOW_PKT: 987 and SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT: 52 indicate a wide range of packet sizes, which could be used to evade detection mechanisms.
- NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 41, NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES: 7, and NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES: 5 show a distribution of packet sizes that is not typical for regular network traffic.

5. Unusual TTL Values:
- MIN_TTL: 63 and MAX_TTL: 63 suggest that the TTL values are fixed, which is uncommon and could be an attempt to avoid detection.

6. ICMP and DNS Anomalies:
- ICMP_TYPE: 15104 and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 59 have non-standard values that could be used for malicious purposes.
- DNS_QUERY_ID, DNS_QUERY_TYPE, and DNS_TTL_ANSWER all set to 0 indicate lack of typical DNS activity.

Based on these observations, the combination of these features in the NetFlow data suggests potentially malicious behavior, warranting further investigation and mitigation actions.
