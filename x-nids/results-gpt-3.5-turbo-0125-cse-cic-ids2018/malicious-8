This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several indicators that suggest suspicious behavior. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Protocol and Port Combination**: The combination of Protocol 6 (TCP) with Destination Port 21 (FTP) is commonly associated with malicious activities, as FTP is often exploited for unauthorized data transfers or command execution.

2. **Abnormal TCP Flags**: The TCP Flags value of 22 indicates multiple flags set in the TCP header, which could be indicative of abnormal or potentially malicious behavior.

3. **Asymmetric Throughput**: The significant difference between the average throughput from source to destination (24000) and destination to source (16000) is unusual and could suggest asymmetric data transfer patterns often seen in malicious activities.

4. **High Flow Duration**: The flow duration of 4294763 milliseconds (approximately 71 minutes) is relatively long for a single FTP connection, which could indicate prolonged data exfiltration or unauthorized access.

5. **Unusual Packet Lengths**: The presence of packets with lengths ranging from 40 to 60 bytes is atypical for a standard FTP transfer, which may indicate data manipulation or obfuscation.

6. **Zero Retransmitted Bytes and Packets**: The absence of any retransmitted bytes or packets is uncommon in legitimate network traffic and could suggest an attempt to avoid detection by not retransmitting lost data.

7. **Max TCP Window Size Discrepancy**: The significant difference between the maximum TCP window size in the incoming (26883) and outgoing (0) directions could indicate asymmetric traffic patterns or potential attempts to overwhelm the receiving end.

In conclusion, the combination of these features in the NetFlow data sample suggests potentially malicious behavior, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation actions to prevent any security threats.
