This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Let's break down the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Protocol (L7_PROTO: 131.7):** The Layer 7 protocol value of 131.7 is not a standard protocol and could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual protocol being used.

2. **High TCP Flags (TCP_FLAGS: 219):** The TCP flags value of 219 is unusually high and may suggest an attempt to manipulate or exploit the TCP communication.

3. **Discrepancy in TCP Flags (CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS vs. SERVER_TCP_FLAGS):** The discrepancy between the client and server TCP flags (219 vs. 27) could indicate an attempt to deceive or manipulate the communication between the client and server.

4. **Zero Flow Duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, DURATION_OUT):** The flow duration values being zero suggest that the communication was very short-lived, which is often a characteristic of malicious activities like port scanning or reconnaissance.

5. **Unusual Packet Lengths (MIN_IP_PKT_LEN, MAX_IP_PKT_LEN):** The range of packet lengths from 40 to 366 is quite wide and could indicate abnormal packet behavior, potentially related to malicious activities like data exfiltration or injection.

6. **High Throughput (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT):** The high average throughput values suggest a significant amount of data being transferred between the source and destination, which could be indicative of a potential data exfiltration attempt.

7. **Low Time-to-Live (TTL) Values (MIN_TTL, MAX_TTL):** The TTL values of 128 indicate that the packets may have traveled a very short distance, which could be a sign of spoofing or tunneling techniques used in malicious activities.

Based on these feature values, the NetFlow data exhibits several characteristics commonly associated with malicious network activities, prompting the Network Intrusion Detection System to flag it as potentially harmful.
