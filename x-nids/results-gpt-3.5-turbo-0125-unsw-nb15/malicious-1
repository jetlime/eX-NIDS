The provided NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here is an analysis of the specific feature values that support this conclusion:

1. **Unusual Source and Destination IP Addresses**: The IPV4_SRC_ADDR (175.45.176.0) and IPV4_DST_ADDR (149.171.126.19) are not typical or expected in normal network traffic, indicating a potential malicious source targeting a specific destination.

2. **Non-Standard Source and Destination Ports**: The L4_SRC_PORT (9979) and L4_DST_PORT (179) are not commonly associated with standard services. Port 179 is typically used for BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), and the combination of these ports could be indicative of a port scanning or malicious activity.

3. **Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol**: The PROTOCOL value of 6 indicates TCP, which is commonly used for various network services. However, the L7_PROTO value of 0.0 suggests an unknown or unsupported Layer 7 protocol, which could be an attempt to obfuscate the actual application layer protocol.

4. **Unusual Flow Duration**: The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, and DURATION_OUT values of 0 indicate that the flow was very short-lived, which is often a characteristic of malicious activities like port scanning or reconnaissance.

5. **Abnormal Packet Sizes and TTL Values**: The MIN_TTL and MAX_TTL values of 254 and 255, respectively, are atypical and could be an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, the range of packet sizes (MIN_IP_PKT_LEN and MAX_IP_PKT_LEN) is narrow, which may indicate a specific type of traffic pattern.

6. **Retransmitted Packets**: The presence of RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS values suggests potential packet retransmission, which can be a sign of network scanning or malicious behavior.

7. **High Throughput**: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT values are unusually high, indicating a potentially aggressive or abnormal data transfer rate that could be part of a malicious activity.

8. **Unusual ICMP Type**: The ICMP_TYPE value of 21760 is not a standard ICMP type and could be indicative of a malformed or malicious ICMP packet.

Based on these indicators, the combination of unusual IP addresses, ports, protocol behavior, flow characteristics, and packet attributes in the provided NetFlow data suggests a malicious intent behind the observed network activity.
