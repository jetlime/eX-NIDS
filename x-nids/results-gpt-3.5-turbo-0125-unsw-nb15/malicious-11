This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several indicators that suggest suspicious behavior. Here are some specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. Unusual Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol:
- PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP)
- L7_PROTO: 7.0
The combination of TCP protocol and an unusual Layer 7 protocol value (7.0) could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual application or service being used, which is a common tactic employed by malicious actors to evade detection.

2. Abnormal Flow Characteristics:
- FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0
- DURATION_IN: 0
- DURATION_OUT: 0
The flow duration values being zero suggest that the communication was very short-lived, which is often indicative of malicious activities like port scanning or reconnaissance.

3. Unusual Packet and Byte Counts:
- IN_BYTES: 818
- IN_PKTS: 10
- OUT_BYTES: 256
- OUT_PKTS: 6
The significant difference in the number of incoming and outgoing packets and bytes could be a sign of asymmetric traffic, which is commonly observed in certain types of attacks such as data exfiltration or command and control communication.

4. Suspicious TTL Values:
- MIN_TTL: 254
- MAX_TTL: 255
The TTL (Time To Live) values being very close to the maximum suggest that the traffic may have traversed through a small number of hops, which could be an attempt to avoid detection or hide the original source of the traffic.

5. Retransmission of Packets:
- RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 233
- RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1
The presence of retransmitted packets could indicate network congestion, packet loss, or potentially malicious activities like a TCP-based attack.

6. Unusual Throughput:
- SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 6544000
- DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 2048000
The high throughput values could indicate abnormal data transfer rates, which might be an indication of a data exfiltration attempt or a large-scale attack.

Based on these feature values and indicators, the NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to the presence of multiple characteristics commonly associated with suspicious or malicious network activities.
