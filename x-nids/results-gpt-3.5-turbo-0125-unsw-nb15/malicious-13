This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here is an analysis based on the specific feature values provided:

1. **Unusual Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol**:
   - PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP) is a common protocol, but the L7_PROTO value of 13.0 is unusual and may indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual application layer protocol.
   
2. **Unusual Traffic Patterns**:
   - The flow duration is very short (0 milliseconds), which is atypical for legitimate network traffic.
   - The number of packets and bytes in both directions is imbalanced, with a significantly higher amount of incoming traffic compared to outgoing traffic.
   
3. **TCP Flags**:
   - The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS values of 19 indicate specific flag combinations that could be associated with malicious activities like port scanning or reconnaissance.
   
4. **TTL Values**:
   - The minimum TTL of 254 and maximum TTL of 255 suggest that the traffic may be attempting to evade detection by setting TTL values close to the maximum.
   
5. **Retransmitted Packets**:
   - The presence of retransmitted packets (RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS) may indicate potential packet loss or retransmission due to network scanning or exploitation attempts.
   
6. **Throughput**:
   - The high average throughput values in both directions (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT) are unusual and may indicate a potential DDoS attack or data exfiltration.
   
7. **Packet Size Distribution**:
   - The distribution of packet sizes, as indicated by the NUM_PKTS_*_BYTES fields, shows a high number of packets in the range of 1024 to 1514 bytes, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or large payload transfers.
   
8. **ICMP and DNS Fields**:
   - Unusual values for ICMP_TYPE and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE, as well as zero values for DNS related fields, suggest potential attempts to bypass network security controls or hide malicious activities.
   
9. **FTP Command Ret Code**:
   - The FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE value of 0.0 indicates that no FTP command return codes were observed, which could be an attempt to avoid detection or hide malicious FTP activities.

Based on these indicators, the NetFlow data sample exhibits multiple characteristics commonly associated with malicious network activities, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation actions.
