This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here's an analysis based on the provided feature values:

1. **IPV4_SRC_ADDR: 175.45.176.3** - The source IP address is from a potentially malicious or suspicious range.

2. **L4_SRC_PORT: 47439** - Unusual high port number for the source port, which could be an indicator of malicious activity.

3. **IPV4_DST_ADDR: 149.171.126.18** - The destination IP address is different from the source, which is common in malicious traffic to hide the origin.

4. **L4_DST_PORT: 53** - Destination port 53 is commonly associated with DNS traffic, but in this context, it could be used for DNS tunneling or other malicious activities.

5. **PROTOCOL: 17** - Indicates UDP protocol, which can be used for various types of attacks due to its connectionless nature.

6. **IN_BYTES: 114, IN_PKTS: 2** - Low volume of incoming traffic, which is often seen in reconnaissance or stealthy attacks.

7. **MIN_TTL: 254, MAX_TTL: 254** - Maximum Time-to-Live value suggests that the packet has traveled a very short distance, possibly indicating a local network scan or attack.

8. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 912000** - Unusually high throughput rate, which could be an attempt to overwhelm the destination with traffic (DDoS attack).

9. **DNS_QUERY_ID: 35843, DNS_QUERY_TYPE: 255** - Unusual DNS query ID and type, which could be an attempt to obfuscate the DNS traffic for malicious purposes.

10. **FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE: 0.0** - The FTP command return code is 0, which could indicate an attempt to establish a connection without proper authentication.

Based on these features, the NetFlow data exhibits characteristics commonly associated with malicious activities such as reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or denial of service attacks. The combination of these indicators raises red flags and warrants further investigation and potential mitigation actions.
