This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Protocol Usage**:
   - PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP)
   - L7_PROTO: 7.0 (Unknown Layer 7 protocol)
   - This combination of TCP as the transport layer protocol with an unknown Layer 7 protocol is uncommon and could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual communication.

2. **Unusual Traffic Patterns**:
   - IN_BYTES: 818, OUT_BYTES: 256
   - IN_PKTS: 10, OUT_PKTS: 6
   - The data transfer ratio between incoming and outgoing bytes and packets is skewed, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or a data transfer attack.

3. **Abnormal TTL Values**:
   - MIN_TTL: 254, MAX_TTL: 255
   - The Time-to-Live (TTL) values are at the maximum limit, which is unusual and could be an attempt to evade detection by manipulating packet TTL values.

4. **Retransmitted Packets**:
   - RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1, RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 233
   - The presence of retransmitted packets could indicate network congestion, packet loss, or potentially malicious behavior like a replay attack.

5. **Unusual Throughput**:
   - SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 6544000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 2048000
   - The significantly high throughput values suggest abnormal data transfer rates, which could be a sign of malicious activity such as a DoS attack or data exfiltration.

6. **ICMP and DNS Anomalies**:
   - ICMP_TYPE: 59648, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 233
   - DNS_QUERY_ID: 0, DNS_QUERY_TYPE: 0, DNS_TTL_ANSWER: 0
   - The ICMP and DNS-related fields contain unexpected values, which could indicate attempts to exploit network protocols for malicious purposes.

Based on these features, the NetFlow data sample exhibits multiple characteristics that are commonly associated with malicious network activities, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation actions.
