This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious characteristics that indicate potentially harmful behavior. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Source and Destination IP Addresses**: The source IP address (175.45.176.0) and destination IP address (149.171.126.11) may not be legitimate or expected in the network context, suggesting a potential attempt to hide the true source or destination.

2. **Non-Standard Port Numbers**: The source port (29860) and destination port (520) are not commonly associated with standard services, which could indicate an attempt to evade detection by using non-standard ports.

3. **Protocol**: The protocol value of 17 indicates UDP traffic, which can be used for various types of attacks, including DDoS attacks or data exfiltration.

4. **Low Flow Duration**: The flow duration of 0 milliseconds is highly unusual for a network communication, suggesting a short-lived or potentially malicious connection.

5. **Identical TTL Values**: The minimum and maximum TTL values of 254 are identical, which is uncommon in normal network traffic and could be an attempt to avoid TTL-based detection mechanisms.

6. **Unidirectional Traffic**: The flow contains incoming bytes but no outgoing bytes, which is suspicious as most legitimate communications involve bidirectional traffic.

7. **High Throughput**: The average throughput from source to destination is unusually high at 832,000 bytes per second, which could indicate a potential data exfiltration attempt.

8. **Packet Size Distribution**: The distribution of packet sizes with all packets falling in the range of up to 128 bytes is atypical and could be indicative of a specific type of attack or data transfer method.

Based on these features, the NetFlow data exhibits multiple characteristics commonly associated with malicious network activity, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation actions.
