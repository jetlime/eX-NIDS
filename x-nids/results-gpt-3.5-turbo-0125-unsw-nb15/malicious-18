This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious characteristics:

1. Unusual Protocol Usage:
- PROTOCOL: 6 indicates TCP protocol, which is commonly used for establishing reliable connections. However, the L7_PROTO value of 0.0 suggests that the application layer protocol is not identified. This lack of identification could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual communication taking place.

2. Abnormal Traffic Patterns:
- The flow duration is very short at 0 milliseconds, which is atypical for legitimate network traffic.
- The number of packets and bytes transferred in both directions is relatively low (10 in packets and 552 in bytes in, 8 in packets and 336 in bytes out), which could be indicative of a quick data transfer or a reconnaissance activity.

3. Unusual TTL Values:
- The minimum TTL value of 254 and maximum TTL value of 255 are uncommon and could be an attempt to evade detection by altering the TTL values.

4. Retransmission Activity:
- The presence of retransmitted bytes and packets (100 bytes retransmitted in 1 packet) could indicate potential data corruption or attempts to exploit network vulnerabilities.

5. High Throughput:
- The average throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 4416000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 2688000) are unusually high, which could be an indication of a potential DDoS attack or other malicious activities.

6. Unusual ICMP Type:
- The ICMP_TYPE value of 25600 is not a standard ICMP type and could be used for malicious purposes.

Based on these features, the NetFlow data exhibits several anomalies that collectively suggest malicious intent, such as evasion techniques, unusual traffic patterns, and potentially harmful activities.
