This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Protocol Behavior**:
   - PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP) and L7_PROTO: 7.0 (Unknown Layer 7 Protocol): The combination of a standard TCP protocol with an unknown Layer 7 protocol can indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual communication taking place.

2. **Abnormal Traffic Patterns**:
   - IN_BYTES: 1392, IN_PKTS: 14, OUT_BYTES: 2332, OUT_PKTS: 12: The traffic volume and packet count are not typical for a regular communication session, suggesting potential data exfiltration or malicious activity.

3. **TCP Flags Anomalies**:
   - TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19: The presence of unusual TCP flags can indicate attempts to evade detection or perform unauthorized actions.

4. **Zero Flow Duration**:
   - FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0: The flow duration being zero is uncommon for legitimate traffic and may indicate a quick, potentially malicious communication attempt.

5. **Retransmission of Data**:
   - RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 480, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 2, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 998, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 2: Retransmitted data can be a sign of network scanning, reconnaissance, or potential exploitation attempts.

6. **Unusual Throughput**:
   - SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 11136000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 18656000: The high throughput values may indicate abnormal data transfer rates, potentially associated with malicious activities.

7. **ICMP and DNS Irregularities**:
   - ICMP_TYPE: 57344, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 224, DNS_QUERY_ID: 0, DNS_QUERY_TYPE: 0, DNS_TTL_ANSWER: 0: The presence of abnormal ICMP and DNS-related values can suggest attempts to exploit network protocols for malicious purposes.

8. **FTP Command Ret Code**:
   - FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE: 0.0: An FTP command return code of 0.0 may indicate an unsuccessful or potentially malicious FTP interaction.

In conclusion, the combination of these suspicious feature values in the NetFlow data suggests malicious intent, potentially involving data exfiltration, reconnaissance, or exploitation attempts. Further investigation and mitigation actions are recommended to address this security threat.
