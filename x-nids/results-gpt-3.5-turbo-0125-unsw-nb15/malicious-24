This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Protocol Usage**: The combination of PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP) and L7_PROTO: 7.0 (which typically represents a protocol anomaly) can indicate potential malicious activity, as it suggests an abnormal or unauthorized use of network protocols.

2. **Abnormal Traffic Patterns**:
   - **High Throughput**: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT value of 7424000 and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT value of 2048000 are unusually high, indicating potentially malicious data transfer or exfiltration.
   - **Retransmitted Packets**: The presence of RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 288 and RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1 suggests potential packet retransmission, which can be a sign of network scanning or reconnaissance.

3. **TCP Flags**:
   - **TCP_FLAGS**: The value of 19 for TCP_FLAGS indicates multiple flags set in the TCP header, which could be indicative of a variety of suspicious activities, such as port scanning or network probing.

4. **TTL Values**:
   - **MIN_TTL and MAX_TTL**: The values of 254 and 255, respectively, for MIN_TTL and MAX_TTL are atypical and could be an attempt to evade detection by manipulating Time-To-Live values.

5. **Packet Lengths**:
   - **LONGEST_FLOW_PKT and SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT**: The disparity between the longest and shortest flow packet lengths (288 and 40, respectively) could be a sign of packet fragmentation or abnormal packet size distribution, which is often associated with malicious activities.

6. **ICMP and DNS Fields**:
   - **ICMP_TYPE and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE**: Unusual values of 8192 and 32 for ICMP types can indicate potential ICMP tunneling or covert communication.
   - **DNS_QUERY_ID, DNS_QUERY_TYPE, DNS_TTL_ANSWER**: The values of 0 for these DNS-related fields could suggest abnormal DNS behavior, potentially related to DNS tunneling or data exfiltration.

Based on these indicators, the NetFlow data sample exhibits characteristics commonly associated with malicious network activities, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation measures.
