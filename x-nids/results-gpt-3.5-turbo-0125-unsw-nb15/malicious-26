This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several indicators present in the sample. Here are some specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. Unusual Protocol: The PROTOCOL field indicates a value of 6, which corresponds to TCP. This is a common protocol used for various legitimate network communications. However, in this context, the combination of other features suggests potential malicious activity.

2. Abnormal Flow Duration: The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, and DURATION_OUT fields all have a value of 0, indicating an extremely short flow duration. Malicious actors often attempt to evade detection by keeping their activities brief.

3. Unusual TTL Values: The MIN_TTL and MAX_TTL fields have values of 254 and 255, respectively. These values are atypical and could indicate attempts to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.

4. Retransmitted Packets: The presence of RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES, along with corresponding packet counts, suggests potential packet loss or retransmission, which can be indicative of malicious behavior attempting to disrupt communication.

5. High Throughput: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT fields have high values, indicating significant data transfer rates. This could be a sign of data exfiltration or other malicious activities.

6. Unusual ICMP Type: The ICMP_TYPE and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE fields have values of 52480 and 205, respectively, which are not typical ICMP types. This could indicate potential ICMP-based attacks or abnormal ICMP traffic.

7. Zero DNS and FTP Activity: The DNS_QUERY_ID, DNS_QUERY_TYPE, DNS_TTL_ANSWER, and FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE fields all have values of 0, suggesting a lack of DNS or FTP activity. This could be an attempt to avoid detection or hide the true nature of the traffic.

In summary, the combination of these features in the NetFlow data sample raises red flags and indicates potential malicious intent behind the observed network traffic.
