This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious features present in the sample. Let's analyze the specific feature values to support this conclusion:

1. **Unusual Protocol and Ports**:
   - The protocol used is TCP (Protocol: 6), which is commonly exploited by malicious actors for various attacks.
   - The destination port is 25 (L4_DST_PORT: 25), which is typically associated with SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) used for sending email. Malicious actors often abuse this port for sending spam or conducting phishing attacks.

2. **Abnormal Traffic Patterns**:
   - The flow duration is unusually long (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294951), which could indicate a prolonged connection associated with malicious activities.
   - There is a significant discrepancy between incoming and outgoing bytes (IN_BYTES: 195184, OUT_BYTES: 2618), which is indicative of asymmetric traffic flow commonly seen in certain types of attacks.

3. **Retransmission of Data**:
   - The presence of retransmitted bytes and packets (RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 97416, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 78) suggests potential data retransmission, which can be a sign of network scanning or reconnaissance activities.

4. **Unusual Packet Sizes**:
   - The range of packet sizes is quite varied, with the longest flow packet being 1500 bytes (LONGEST_FLOW_PKT: 1500) and the shortest being 40 bytes (SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT: 40). This diversity in packet sizes could be an indicator of data exfiltration or evasion techniques.

5. **Abnormal Throughput**:
   - The average throughput from source to destination (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 91848000) and from destination to source (DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 1232000) is significantly high, which could be an indication of a potential DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack.

6. **Unusual ICMP Type**:
   - The ICMP type value (ICMP_TYPE: 34817) is not a standard ICMP type, indicating potential ICMP-based attacks or abnormal ICMP traffic.

Based on these observations, the combination of these features in the NetFlow data suggests malicious intent, potentially involving activities such as network scanning, data exfiltration, or DDoS attacks. It is advisable to investigate further and take appropriate action to mitigate the threat.
