This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here's an analysis based on the provided feature values:

1. **Unusual Communication**: The communication is between IPV4_SRC_ADDR 175.45.176.1 and IPV4_DST_ADDR 149.171.126.14, with non-standard port numbers (L4_SRC_PORT: 2287 and L4_DST_PORT: 65446). This combination of IP addresses and port numbers is not typical for regular traffic.

2. **Protocol and TCP Flags**: The PROTOCOL value of 6 indicates TCP traffic. The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS all having a value of 19 is suspicious as it suggests a combination of flags that is not commonly seen in legitimate traffic.

3. **Flow Duration**: The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, and DURATION_OUT all being 0 indicates a very short-lived flow, which is often indicative of malicious activity attempting to evade detection.

4. **Packet Lengths and Throughput**: The packet lengths (MIN_IP_PKT_LEN, MAX_IP_PKT_LEN) and throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT) are unusually high for the number of packets exchanged, which could be a sign of data exfiltration or a DoS attack.

5. **Retransmitted Packets**: The presence of RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS values indicates potential packet retransmission, which can be a sign of network scanning or reconnaissance activities.

6. **TTL Values**: The TTL values (MIN_TTL, MAX_TTL) being very close together (62 and 63) is uncommon and could be an attempt to avoid detection by manipulating TTL values.

7. **Packet Size Distribution**: The distribution of packet sizes (NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES, NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES, etc.) is skewed towards smaller packets, which could be an attempt to obfuscate the actual payload size.

In conclusion, the combination of these features in the NetFlow data suggests suspicious behavior that is characteristic of malicious activities such as network scanning, reconnaissance, or potentially a targeted attack.
