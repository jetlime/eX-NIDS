This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious characteristics that deviate from normal network traffic patterns. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **L4_SRC_PORT and L4_DST_PORT are both 0**: This indicates that the source and destination ports are not specified, which is unusual for legitimate network traffic where ports are typically assigned for communication.

2. **PROTOCOL: 191**: The protocol value of 191 is not a standard protocol number defined by the IANA, suggesting that this traffic is using a non-standard or potentially malicious protocol.

3. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, and DURATION_OUT are all 0**: The lack of any duration for the flow indicates a very short-lived connection, which is often a characteristic of malicious activities such as port scanning or denial of service attacks.

4. **MIN_TTL and MAX_TTL both at 254**: TTL (Time To Live) values at the maximum limit suggest that the packets are not traversing through a typical network path and could be part of a spoofing or evasion attempt.

5. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT is 1600000**: The extremely high throughput value is uncommon for regular traffic and could indicate a potential data exfiltration attempt or a high-volume attack.

6. **NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 2**: The presence of only two small packets suggests a very limited communication pattern, which is often associated with reconnaissance or stealthy data transfer techniques.

7. **ICMP_TYPE and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE are both 0**: Zero values for ICMP types indicate a lack of specific ICMP messages being used, which could be an attempt to avoid detection or hide the true nature of the traffic.

Based on these anomalous feature values, the NetFlow data is flagged as malicious by the Network Intrusion Detection System due to its deviation from normal network behavior and potential indicators of malicious intent.
