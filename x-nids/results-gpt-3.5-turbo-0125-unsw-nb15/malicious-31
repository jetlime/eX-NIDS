This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Port Combination**: The source port (L4_SRC_PORT) is 58740, and the destination port (L4_DST_PORT) is 514. Port 514 is commonly associated with the syslog service, and the combination of these ports could indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability or perform unauthorized access.

2. **Protocol Mismatch**: The protocol field (PROTOCOL) indicates UDP (17), while the Layer 7 protocol (L7_PROTO) also shows UDP (17.0). This consistency could be an attempt to mask the malicious traffic as legitimate UDP communication.

3. **Low Flow Duration**: The flow duration in milliseconds (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS) is 0, which is unusual for a legitimate network flow. Malicious actors often try to minimize the time of their activities to avoid detection.

4. **Unidirectional Traffic**: The flow contains incoming bytes (IN_BYTES: 956) but no outgoing bytes (OUT_BYTES: 0), suggesting a potential data exfiltration attempt or a one-way communication pattern commonly seen in malicious activities.

5. **Abnormal Packet Sizes**: The flow contains packets in the range of 256 to 512 bytes (NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES: 2), which could be an indicator of data exfiltration or a specific type of attack.

6. **Max TTL Value**: The maximum Time-to-Live (TTL) value (MAX_TTL) of 254 is suspiciously high and could be an attempt to evade detection by making the traffic appear legitimate.

7. **No TCP Flags**: The absence of any TCP flags (TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS) in a UDP flow is unusual and could indicate an attempt to bypass security measures that focus on TCP traffic.

In conclusion, the combination of these features in the NetFlow data suggests that the observed traffic is potentially malicious and warrants further investigation and mitigation actions.
