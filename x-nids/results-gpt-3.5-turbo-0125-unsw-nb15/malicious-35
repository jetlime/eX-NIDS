This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. Unusual Protocol: The PROTOCOL value of 6 indicates that the traffic is using TCP, which is commonly used for legitimate web traffic. However, the L7_PROTO value of 7.0 suggests that the Layer 7 protocol is unknown or potentially malicious.

2. Abnormal Traffic Patterns: The flow duration is very short (0 milliseconds), and the number of packets and bytes transferred is relatively low compared to typical web traffic. This could indicate a quick, potentially malicious communication attempt.

3. Unusual TTL Values: The MIN_TTL and MAX_TTL values are at their extremes (254 and 255, respectively), which is uncommon for regular network traffic and could be an attempt to evade detection.

4. Retransmitted Packets: The presence of RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS values indicates that there were retransmitted packets during the communication, which can be a sign of network scanning or reconnaissance activities.

5. High Throughput: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT values are unusually high, suggesting a potentially aggressive or abnormal data transfer rate.

6. Unusual ICMP Type: The ICMP_TYPE and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE values are not typical for regular network traffic and could be indicative of ICMP-based attacks or unusual behavior.

7. Suspicious TCP Flags: The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS values of 19 indicate specific flag combinations that could be used in malicious activities, such as port scanning or exploitation attempts.

Based on these indicators, the NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to the presence of multiple suspicious characteristics that deviate from normal network traffic patterns.
