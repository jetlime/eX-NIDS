This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious characteristics:

1. **Unusual Port Usage**: The source port (L4_SRC_PORT) is 8007, which is not a common port for outgoing traffic. Additionally, the destination port (L4_DST_PORT) is 25, which is typically used for SMTP (email) traffic. This combination of ports could indicate an attempt to bypass security measures or perform unauthorized activities.

2. **High TCP Flags**: The TCP_FLAGS value of 27 indicates multiple TCP flags are set, which could be indicative of abnormal behavior such as a scan or attack.

3. **Unusual Traffic Patterns**: The flow duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS) is 0, which is unusual for a legitimate network flow. Additionally, the high ratio of incoming bytes to outgoing bytes and the presence of retransmitted packets suggest potential malicious activity like data exfiltration or a DoS attack.

4. **Abnormal ICMP Type**: The ICMP_TYPE value of 31232 is not a standard ICMP type, indicating potential misuse of ICMP for malicious purposes.

5. **DNS and FTP Anomalies**: The DNS and FTP-related fields (DNS_QUERY_ID, DNS_QUERY_TYPE, DNS_TTL_ANSWER, FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE) having values of 0 suggest that the flow may be attempting to hide its activities by not engaging in typical DNS or FTP interactions.

In summary, the combination of unusual port usage, high TCP flags, abnormal traffic patterns, anomalous ICMP type, and lack of expected DNS and FTP behavior in the NetFlow data all contribute to flagging this flow as potentially malicious.
