The provided NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. Unusual Protocol (L7_PROTO: 20.0): The Layer 7 protocol value of 20.0 is not a standard protocol and could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual protocol being used.

2. Abnormal TCP Flags (TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19): The TCP flags value of 19 is unusual as it does not correspond to any standard combination of TCP flags. This could be an attempt to evade detection or exploit vulnerabilities.

3. Zero Flow Duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, DURATION_OUT: 0): The flow duration being zero is suspicious as it suggests a very short-lived connection, which is often associated with malicious activities like port scanning or reconnaissance.

4. Unusual ICMP Type (ICMP_TYPE: 31232): The ICMP type value of 31232 is not a valid ICMP type and could indicate an attempt to misuse the ICMP protocol for malicious purposes.

5. Unusual DNS and FTP Values (DNS_QUERY_ID, DNS_QUERY_TYPE, DNS_TTL_ANSWER, FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE: 0): The DNS and FTP feature values being set to zero are abnormal and could indicate attempts to hide or manipulate DNS and FTP activities.

In summary, the combination of these suspicious feature values in the NetFlow data suggests potential malicious intent, such as evasion techniques, protocol manipulation, and abnormal network behavior. It is recommended to investigate further and take appropriate actions to mitigate any potential security threats.
