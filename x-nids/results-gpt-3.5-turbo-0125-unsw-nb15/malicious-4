Based on the provided NetFlow data, the flagged traffic is considered malicious due to several suspicious characteristics:

1. **Unusual Protocol Usage**: The combination of Protocol 6 (TCP) with L7_PROTO 0.0 (unknown Layer 7 protocol) is uncommon and could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual application layer protocol being used.

2. **Abnormal Traffic Patterns**:
   - The flow duration is very short at 0 milliseconds, which is atypical for legitimate network traffic.
   - The number of packets and bytes sent in both directions is disproportionate, with more packets sent from the source to the destination compared to the reverse direction. This could be indicative of a data exfiltration attempt.
   - The presence of retransmitted packets suggests potential packet loss or network issues, which could be exploited in a malicious context.

3. **Suspicious TTL Values**:
   - The TTL values (Minimum TTL: 62, Maximum TTL: 63) are unusually low, which could indicate traffic manipulation or spoofing attempts.

4. **Unusual Packet Lengths**:
   - The range of packet lengths (Shortest Flow Packet: 40, Longest Flow Packet: 873) is wide, which could be indicative of abnormal packet fragmentation or data manipulation.

5. **High Throughput**:
   - The average throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 21488000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 13392000) are abnormally high, which could suggest a potential DDoS attack or data transfer activity.

6. **Non-standard ICMP Type**:
   - The ICMP Type value of 36608 is not a standard ICMP type, which could indicate a malformed or malicious ICMP packet.

7. **FTP Command Ret Code**:
   - The FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE of 0.0 could indicate an unsuccessful FTP command execution, which may be part of an attack or reconnaissance activity.

In conclusion, the combination of these suspicious characteristics in the provided NetFlow data suggests that the traffic is potentially malicious and warrants further investigation or mitigation measures by the Network Intrusion Detection System.
