This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are some specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Port Usage**: The source port (L4_SRC_PORT) is 64624, which is not a common port for outgoing traffic. This high port number could be indicative of an attempt to evade detection or perform malicious activities.

2. **Protocol Mismatch**: The Layer 4 protocol (PROTOCOL) is 6 (TCP), but the Layer 7 protocol (L7_PROTO) is 0.0, indicating a mismatch between the two protocol layers. This inconsistency could be a sign of malicious behavior attempting to obfuscate the true nature of the traffic.

3. **Unusual Traffic Patterns**: The flow duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS) is 0, which is unusual for a legitimate network flow. Additionally, the high average throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT) suggest potentially malicious activities such as data exfiltration or large-scale data transfer.

4. **Retransmission Activity**: The presence of retransmitted bytes and packets (RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS) indicates potential network congestion or attempts to disrupt communication, which are common tactics used in malicious activities.

5. **Abnormal ICMP Type**: The ICMP type (ICMP_TYPE) is 60672, which is not a standard ICMP type. This abnormality could be a sign of ICMP tunneling or other malicious ICMP-based activities.

6. **Unusual DNS and FTP Behavior**: The DNS and FTP-related fields (DNS_QUERY_ID, DNS_QUERY_TYPE, DNS_TTL_ANSWER, FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE) having values of 0 suggest that the traffic may be attempting to hide its true nature by not conforming to expected DNS or FTP behavior.

In conclusion, the combination of these suspicious indicators in the NetFlow data suggests that the observed traffic is likely malicious and warrants further investigation and mitigation.
