This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious characteristics:

1. **Unidirectional Traffic**: The flow is one-way, with data only going from the source IP (175.45.176.1) to the destination IP (149.171.126.11). Typically, legitimate communication involves bidirectional traffic.

2. **Protocol Mismatch**: The protocol field indicates UDP (17), but the Layer 7 protocol is also specified as UDP (17.0). This redundancy could be an attempt to obfuscate the actual protocol being used.

3. **Abnormal Packet Lengths**: The flow contains only two packets, both with a length of 870 bytes. This fixed packet size is unusual and could be an indicator of malicious activity.

4. **Zero Outgoing Bytes and Packets**: The flow shows incoming bytes and packets but no outgoing data. This behavior is atypical for normal network communication patterns.

5. **Zero Flow Duration**: The flow duration is recorded as 0 milliseconds, which is highly irregular for a network communication session.

6. **Constant TTL Values**: The minimum and maximum TTL values are both 254, which could indicate an attempt to avoid detection by maintaining a consistent TTL value.

7. **High Throughput**: The average throughput from source to destination is abnormally high at 13.92 Mbps, which could be an indicator of a potential DDoS attack or data exfiltration.

Based on these features, the NetFlow data exhibits multiple anomalies that are commonly associated with malicious network traffic, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation actions.
