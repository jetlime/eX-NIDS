This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Communication**: The communication is from IP address 175.45.176.3 to IP address 149.171.126.16 on non-standard ports (1364 and 520) for the specified protocol (UDP - Protocol 17). This deviation from common port usage can be indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Zero Flow Duration**: The flow duration is recorded as 0 milliseconds, which is highly unusual for a legitimate network communication. Typically, legitimate flows have a non-zero duration.

3. **Unidirectional Traffic**: The flow shows inbound bytes (584) but no outbound bytes, indicating a unidirectional communication pattern. This asymmetry in traffic can be a sign of data exfiltration or a one-way attack.

4. **Abnormal Packet Sizes**: The flow contains packets of a fixed size (292 bytes), which could be an indicator of a specific type of attack or data transfer method.

5. **High Throughput**: The average throughput from source to destination is very high (4672000 bytes/second), which is uncommon for regular network traffic and may suggest a potential DoS attack or data transfer of large volumes.

6. **Max TTL Value**: The Time-to-Live (TTL) values are set to the maximum (254), which could be an attempt to evade detection or hide the true source of the traffic.

7. **No TCP Flags**: The absence of any TCP flags in the flow data is suspicious, especially for a TCP-based communication. This could indicate an attempt to bypass traditional firewall rules.

Based on these features and anomalies in the NetFlow data, the Network Intrusion Detection System has correctly flagged this flow as malicious. Further investigation and mitigation actions should be taken to address this potential security threat.
