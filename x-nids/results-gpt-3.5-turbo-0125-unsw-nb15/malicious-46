This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here's an analysis based on the provided feature values:

1. **Unusual Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol**: The combination of PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP) and L7_PROTO: 7.0 is unusual. The L7_PROTO value of 7.0 doesn't correspond to any standard application layer protocol, indicating potential obfuscation or non-standard behavior.

2. **High TCP Flags**: The TCP_FLAGS value of 27 is suspiciously high, indicating multiple flags set in the TCP header, which could be indicative of abnormal or malicious activity.

3. **Retransmitted Packets**: The presence of RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES along with RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS suggests retransmission of data packets, which can be a sign of network scanning, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.

4. **Abnormal Throughput**: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT values are significantly high, indicating unusually high data transfer rates that are not typical for regular network traffic.

5. **Unusual ICMP Type**: The ICMP_TYPE value of 35072 and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE of 137 are not standard ICMP types, which could indicate ICMP-based attacks or abnormal ICMP traffic.

6. **Zero DNS Query and Answer Information**: The DNS_QUERY_ID, DNS_QUERY_TYPE, and DNS_TTL_ANSWER values being zero suggest a lack of DNS activity, which is unusual for legitimate network communication.

7. **FTP Command Return Code**: The FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE value of 0.0 indicates that no FTP command return code was received, which could be an attempt to hide malicious FTP activity.

In conclusion, the combination of these suspicious feature values in the NetFlow data sample suggests potentially malicious behavior, such as network scanning, data exfiltration, or other forms of cyber attacks. Further investigation and mitigation actions are recommended to address this potential security threat.
