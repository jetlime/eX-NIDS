This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Port Combination**: The source port (L4_SRC_PORT) is 7812, and the destination port (L4_DST_PORT) is 514. Port 514 is commonly associated with the syslog service, and the combination of these ports could indicate an attempt to bypass firewall rules or exploit vulnerabilities.

2. **Protocol Mismatch**: The protocol field (PROTOCOL) indicates UDP (17), while the Layer 7 protocol (L7_PROTO) also shows UDP (17.0). This consistency could be an attempt to deceive network monitoring systems by presenting consistent but potentially malicious information.

3. **Low Flow Duration**: The flow duration in milliseconds (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS) is 0, which is unusual for a legitimate network flow. Malicious actors often try to minimize the time of their activities to avoid detection.

4. **Unidirectional Traffic**: The flow contains incoming bytes (IN_BYTES: 438) but no outgoing bytes (OUT_BYTES: 0), suggesting a potential data exfiltration attempt or a one-way communication pattern commonly seen in malicious activities.

5. **Abnormal TTL Values**: Both the minimum (MIN_TTL) and maximum (MAX_TTL) Time-To-Live values are 254, which is not a typical range for legitimate traffic. Consistent TTL values could indicate traffic manipulation or spoofing.

6. **Packet Size Anomalies**: The flow includes only two packets (IN_PKTS: 2) with the same size (LONGEST_FLOW_PKT: 219, SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT: 219), which could be an indication of a specific type of attack or scanning activity.

7. **High Throughput**: The average throughput from source to destination (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT) is abnormally high at 3504000 bytes per second, which could be indicative of a potential DDoS attack or data transfer activity.

Based on these indicators, the NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to the combination of unusual port usage, protocol inconsistencies, short flow duration, unidirectional traffic, abnormal TTL values, packet size anomalies, and high throughput, all of which collectively suggest potentially malicious intent behind this network activity.
