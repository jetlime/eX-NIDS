Based on the provided NetFlow data, the flagged flow is considered malicious due to several suspicious characteristics:

1. **Unusual Port Usage**: The source port (54846) and destination port (21) combination is commonly associated with FTP traffic. Port 21 is typically used for FTP control connections, and the high source port number could indicate a non-standard or potentially malicious use of FTP.

2. **Low Data Transfer**: The flow has very low data transfer amounts, with only 9 bytes incoming and 74 bytes outgoing. This minimal data transfer is atypical for legitimate FTP sessions, which usually involve larger file transfers.

3. **TCP Flags**: The TCP flags indicate that both the client and server have the "ACK" flag set (TCP flag value of 16). While this flag combination is not inherently malicious, it could be part of an attempt to establish a connection or perform reconnaissance.

4. **Flow Duration**: The flow duration is extremely short at 0 milliseconds, suggesting a very brief interaction that is not typical of regular network traffic patterns.

5. **TTL Values**: The TTL (Time To Live) values are close to their maximum (254 and 255), which could indicate an attempt to evade detection by setting TTL values to avoid network monitoring.

6. **Throughput**: The high average throughput values in both directions (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 2432000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 2480000) are unusual for the small amount of data transferred, which could be indicative of a potential data exfiltration attempt.

7. **Packet Size Distribution**: The distribution of packet sizes with a high number of packets up to 128 bytes but none in the larger size ranges (128-1514 bytes) is abnormal and could be an indicator of abnormal packet fragmentation or obfuscation techniques.

8. **FTP Command Ret Code**: The FTP command return code of 331 is typically associated with a "User name okay, need password" response, which could be part of an FTP login attempt.

In conclusion, the combination of these features in the NetFlow data suggests that the flow exhibits characteristics commonly associated with malicious or suspicious network activity, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation actions.
