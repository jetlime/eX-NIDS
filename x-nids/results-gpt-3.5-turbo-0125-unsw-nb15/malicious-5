This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample:

1. Unusual Protocol and Port Combination:
- The combination of Protocol 6 (TCP) with Destination Port 21 (FTP) is commonly associated with malicious activities. Port 21 is typically used for FTP data transfers, and its presence in this context could indicate unauthorized file transfers or data exfiltration.

2. Abnormal Flow Characteristics:
- The Flow Duration is recorded as 0 milliseconds, which is highly unusual for a legitimate network flow. Legitimate flows typically have non-zero durations.
- The presence of retransmitted packets (RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS) suggests potential network issues or attempts to evade detection by resending data.

3. Unusual Traffic Patterns:
- The average throughput values (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT) are unusually high, indicating potentially suspicious data transfer rates.
- The number of packets in different size ranges (NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES, NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES, etc.) shows a skewed distribution towards smaller packets, which could be indicative of data obfuscation techniques.

4. ICMP and DNS Anomalies:
- The ICMP_TYPE and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE values are abnormally high, suggesting potential ICMP-based attacks or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
- The DNS-related fields (DNS_QUERY_ID, DNS_QUERY_TYPE, DNS_TTL_ANSWER) being set to 0 indicate lack of legitimate DNS activity, which could be an attempt to hide malicious activities.

Based on these observations, the NetFlow data sample exhibits multiple characteristics commonly associated with malicious network behavior, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation actions.
