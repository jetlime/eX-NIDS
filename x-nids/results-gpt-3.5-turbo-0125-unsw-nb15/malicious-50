This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here's an analysis based on the provided feature values:

1. Unusual Port Usage:
- L4_DST_PORT is set to 21, which is commonly associated with FTP (File Transfer Protocol). This port is often targeted by attackers for unauthorized file transfers or data exfiltration.

2. Abnormal Traffic Behavior:
- IN_BYTES is significantly lower (9 bytes) compared to OUT_BYTES (108 bytes), indicating asymmetric traffic flow, which can be indicative of data exfiltration or a command-and-control communication pattern.

3. TCP Flags:
- The TCP_FLAGS value of 24 suggests the presence of both SYN and ACK flags set, which can be indicative of a TCP handshake attempt. This behavior can be used in port scanning or reconnaissance activities.

4. TTL Values:
- The MIN_TTL and MAX_TTL values of 62 and 63, respectively, are suspiciously low. This could indicate traffic manipulation or spoofing attempts to evade detection.

5. Flow Duration:
- The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, and DURATION_OUT values are all set to 0, which is unusual for a legitimate network flow. This could be an attempt to avoid detection by creating short-lived connections.

6. Throughput:
- The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT values are abnormally high, indicating potentially high data transfer rates that are uncommon for regular network traffic.

Based on these observations, the combination of port usage, traffic behavior, TCP flags, TTL values, flow duration, and throughput metrics collectively suggest malicious intent behind this network flow. Further investigation and mitigation actions should be taken to address this potential security threat.
