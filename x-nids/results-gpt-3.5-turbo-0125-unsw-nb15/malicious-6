This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are the specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. Unusual Communication Pattern:
- The flow duration of 4294935 milliseconds (approximately 71 minutes) is abnormally long for a single communication session, indicating a prolonged connection that may be part of a malicious activity.

2. Port and Protocol Mismatch:
- The combination of source port 65453 and destination port 52610 with Protocol 6 (TCP) is not a common or expected communication pattern, potentially indicating port scanning or other malicious behavior.

3. Unusual Traffic Volume:
- The disparity in incoming and outgoing bytes (352 vs. 1630) with the same number of packets (8) suggests asymmetric traffic flow, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or a covert channel.

4. Abnormal TCP Flags:
- The TCP flags value of 19 is suspicious as it does not correspond to a standard TCP flag combination, potentially indicating an attempt to evade detection or perform unauthorized actions.

5. Retransmission Anomalies:
- The presence of retransmitted out bytes (687) and retransmitted out packets (1) without corresponding retransmitted in bytes or packets suggests potential data manipulation or transmission irregularities.

6. Throughput Discrepancy:
- The significant difference in average throughput from source to destination (80000) and destination to source (392000) is unusual and may indicate a covert communication channel or data transfer method.

7. Packet Size Distribution:
- The distribution of packet sizes with a high number of packets up to 128 bytes (14) and minimal packets in other size ranges is atypical and could be indicative of a specific type of attack or data transfer technique.

Based on these identified features, the NetFlow data sample exhibits multiple characteristics commonly associated with malicious network activities, warranting further investigation and potential mitigation actions.
