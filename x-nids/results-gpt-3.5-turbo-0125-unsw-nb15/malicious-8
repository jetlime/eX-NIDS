This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are some specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. Unusual Protocol and Layer 7 Protocol:
- PROTOCOL: 6 (TCP) is commonly used for legitimate web traffic, but the L7_PROTO value of 7.0 is unusual and may indicate an attempt to obfuscate the actual application layer protocol.
  
2. Abnormal Traffic Patterns:
- The flow duration is very short (0 milliseconds), which is atypical for a legitimate connection.
- The number of packets and bytes transferred in both directions is relatively low compared to typical web traffic, suggesting a potential reconnaissance or probing activity.

3. Suspicious TCP Flags:
- TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS all have a value of 19, which is unusual and may indicate an attempt to bypass normal firewall rules or perform malicious activities.

4. Retransmission of Data:
- The presence of retransmitted packets and bytes suggests potential data exfiltration or evasion techniques being employed by the malicious actor.

5. Unusual ICMP Type:
- The ICMP_TYPE value of 1280 and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE value of 5 are not standard ICMP types and could be indicative of a malicious ICMP-based attack.

6. Abnormal DNS and FTP Behavior:
- The DNS_QUERY_ID, DNS_QUERY_TYPE, DNS_TTL_ANSWER, and FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE values being 0 indicate a lack of legitimate DNS queries or FTP commands, which is suspicious in a network context.

In summary, the combination of these features in the NetFlow data sample suggests malicious intent, potentially involving evasion techniques, data exfiltration, and attempts to obfuscate the true nature of the network traffic.
