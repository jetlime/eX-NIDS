This NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious indicators present in the sample. Here are some specific feature values that support this analysis:

1. **Unusual Port Usage**: The source port (L4_SRC_PORT) is 36891, which is not a common port for outgoing traffic. Port 25 (L4_DST_PORT) is typically associated with SMTP, which could be used for sending spam emails or other malicious activities.

2. **High Retransmission Rate**: The values for RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES, and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS indicate a significant amount of retransmitted data, which can be a sign of network scanning or malicious data exfiltration.

3. **Abnormal Throughput**: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT values are unusually high, suggesting potentially malicious activities such as a DDoS attack or data exfiltration.

4. **Unusual ICMP Type**: The ICMP_TYPE value of 57856 and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE of 226 are not standard ICMP types, indicating potential ICMP-based attacks or abnormal network behavior.

5. **Zero Flow Duration**: The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, and DURATION_OUT values are all zero, which is uncommon for legitimate network traffic and may indicate an attempt to evade detection by quickly establishing and terminating connections.

6. **Large Packet Sizes**: The LONGEST_FLOW_PKT value of 1500 and MAX_IP_PKT_LEN value of 1500 suggest the transmission of large packets, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or other malicious activities.

Based on these indicators, the NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to the presence of multiple suspicious characteristics that deviate from normal network traffic patterns.
