The NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 80**: This is the default port for HTTP traffic. Malicious actors often use this port to blend in with normal web traffic.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in many types of attacks due to its connection-oriented nature.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 219, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 219, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 27**: These values are suspicious because they indicate unusual TCP flag combinations. TCP flags are used to control the state of a TCP connection, and unusual combinations can indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or perform reconnaissance.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294945**: This is a very long flow duration, which could indicate a slow data exfiltration attempt or a long-term reconnaissance effort.

5. **IN_BYTES: 480, OUT_BYTES: 1147**: The number of bytes sent out is significantly higher than the number of bytes received. This could indicate data exfiltration.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 160000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 392000**: The average throughput from the destination to the source is significantly higher than from the source to the destination. This could also indicate data exfiltration.

7. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 65535, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 26883**: The maximum TCP window size for incoming traffic is at its maximum possible value, which could indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target system or network.

8. **MIN_TTL: 127, MAX_TTL: 127**: The Time to Live (TTL) values are the same for all packets. This is unusual and could indicate that the packets are being generated by a script or tool, rather than a standard application or service.

These are just some of the suspicious feature values in this NetFlow data. A more thorough analysis would likely reveal additional indicators of malicious activity.
