The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **TCP_FLAGS (223) and CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS (222):** These values are unusually high. In TCP, the flag field is 6 bits long, so the maximum value should be 63. A value of 223 or 222 suggests that some non-standard flags are being used, which is a common characteristic of malicious traffic.

2. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS (0), DURATION_IN (0), and DURATION_OUT (0):** These values indicate that the flow duration is zero, which is highly unusual. This could suggest a fast, automated process, such as a bot or malware, is generating the traffic.

3. **MIN_TTL (127) and MAX_TTL (127):** These values are the same, which is unusual for legitimate traffic. This could suggest that the traffic is being generated by a single source, which is a common characteristic of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or a botnet.

4. **LONGEST_FLOW_PKT (1004) and SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT (40):** The large difference between the longest and shortest packet lengths could suggest that the traffic contains a mix of different types of packets, which is a common characteristic of malicious traffic.

5. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT (1856000) and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT (9088000):** The average throughput from the source to the destination is significantly lower than the average throughput from the destination to the source. This could suggest that the source is sending a large amount of small packets to the destination, which is a common characteristic of a DoS attack.

6. **L4_DST_PORT (80):** This is the standard port for HTTP traffic. If the traffic is not HTTP (as suggested by the L7_PROTO value of 7.0, which does not correspond to HTTP), this could suggest that the traffic is attempting to masquerade as legitimate HTTP traffic.

7. **NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES (8) and NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES (1):** The majority of packets are small (up to 128 bytes), with only one larger packet (512 to 1024 bytes). This could suggest that the traffic consists of a large number of small, control packets and a small number of larger, data packets, which is a common characteristic of malicious traffic.
