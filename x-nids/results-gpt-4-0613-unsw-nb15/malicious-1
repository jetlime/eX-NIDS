The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 179** - This is the port number for BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), which is used to route traffic across the internet. Unauthorized access to this port could indicate an attempt to manipulate routing tables or perform other malicious activities.

2. **TCP_FLAGS: 19, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 19, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19** - The TCP flag value of 19 corresponds to SYN and FIN flags being set at the same time, which is unusual and often associated with TCP/IP stack fingerprinting attempts or stealth scanning techniques.

3. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0** - These values indicate that the flow duration was extremely short, which is unusual and could suggest a scanning activity or a DoS attack.

4. **MIN_TTL: 254, MAX_TTL: 255** - These values are suspiciously high. TTL (Time to Live) is used to prevent packets from looping indefinitely. High TTL values could indicate an attempt to bypass network security measures.

5. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 85, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1** - Retransmission usually occurs when packets are lost in the network. However, in this case, it could indicate a potential malicious activity such as a TCP retransmission attack.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 4176000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 2688000** - These high throughput values could indicate a potential DDoS attack.

7. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 16383, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383** - These maximum TCP window sizes are suspiciously high, which could indicate an attempt to overload the system or perform a TCP Window Size attack.

8. **ICMP_TYPE: 21760, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 85** - These values are not standard ICMP types and could indicate a potential ICMP tunneling or other ICMP-based attacks.

These suspicious feature values together suggest that the network traffic could be associated with various types of network attacks, such as scanning, DoS/DDoS attacks, TCP/IP stack fingerprinting, TCP retransmission attacks, and ICMP-based attacks.
