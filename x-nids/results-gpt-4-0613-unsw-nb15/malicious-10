The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 111** - Port 111 is used by the portmapper service, which is often targeted by attackers for DDoS reflection attacks or to exploit RPC-based services.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6** - This indicates the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in many types of attacks.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 19, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 19, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19** - The value 19 indicates that the SYN, FIN, and PSH flags are set. This is unusual because SYN and FIN are typically not set in the same packet, and could indicate a type of port scanning or evasion technique.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0** - These values indicate that the flow duration was extremely short, which is unusual and could indicate a scan or a DoS attack.

5. **MIN_TTL: 254, MAX_TTL: 255** - These values are unusually high, which could indicate an attempt to evade TTL-based detection mechanisms.

6. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 100, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1** - Retransmissions can indicate network issues, but they can also be a sign of malicious activity, such as a SYN flood attack.

7. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 4416000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 2688000** - These high throughput values could indicate a large amount of data being transferred in a short amount of time, which could be a sign of data exfiltration or a DoS attack.

8. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 16383, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383** - These maximum TCP window sizes are quite large, which could indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target system or network.

9. **ICMP_TYPE: 25600, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 100** - These values are not standard ICMP types and could indicate malicious activity.

In conclusion, the combination of these suspicious feature values suggests that this NetFlow data is likely associated with malicious activity.
