The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 80**: This is the default port for HTTP traffic. An attacker might be trying to exploit a vulnerability in the HTTP protocol or perform an HTTP flood attack.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This represents the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in various types of attacks, such as SYN flood attacks, TCP/IP hijacking, etc.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 19, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 19, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19**: These values indicate that the SYN, FIN, and PSH flags are set. This is unusual because typically, SYN and FIN flags are not set in the same TCP packet. This could be an indication of a TCP flag manipulation attack, such as a Christmas tree attack or a stealth scan.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0**: These values indicate that the flow duration is zero, which is suspicious. This could be an indication of a fast flux attack, where the attacker rapidly changes the IP addresses associated with a domain name to evade detection.

5. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 233, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1**: These values indicate that there is retransmission in the incoming packets. This could be an indication of a network issue or a potential attack, such as a TCP retransmission attack.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 6544000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 2048000**: The average throughput from the source to the destination is significantly higher than the average throughput from the destination to the source. This could be an indication of a potential DDoS attack, where the attacker is trying to overwhelm the target with a large amount of traffic.

7. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 16383, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383**: These values indicate that the maximum TCP window size for both incoming and outgoing traffic is 16383 bytes. This is the maximum possible value, which is suspicious and could be an indication of a potential TCP window size manipulation attack.

8. **ICMP_TYPE: 59648, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 233**: These values are outside the normal range for ICMP types (0-255), which is suspicious and could be an indication of a potential ICMP attack, such as a ping flood attack or an ICMP tunneling attack.
