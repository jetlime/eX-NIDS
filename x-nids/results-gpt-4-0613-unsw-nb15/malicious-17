The NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **IN_BYTES vs OUT_BYTES**: The IN_BYTES value is 104, which means that 104 bytes of data were sent to the destination address. However, the OUT_BYTES value is 0, which means no data was sent back from the destination to the source. This is unusual and could indicate a one-way communication often associated with malicious activities like data exfiltration or command and control communication.

2. **IN_PKTS vs OUT_PKTS**: Similar to the bytes, there are 2 packets sent from the source to the destination (IN_PKTS: 2), but no packets were sent back (OUT_PKTS: 0). This again suggests a one-way communication which is suspicious.

3. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, DURATION_OUT**: All these values are 0, which means the flow duration was extremely short. This could indicate a quick, automated process, which is often a characteristic of malicious activities.

4. **PROTOCOL: 17**: This indicates that the UDP protocol was used. UDP is a stateless protocol and does not require a handshake like TCP, making it a common choice for malicious activities as it's harder to track.

5. **MIN_TTL and MAX_TTL**: Both are 254, which is unusually high. TTL (Time to Live) is decreased by at least 1 with each hop a packet makes. A high TTL could indicate an attempt to bypass network security measures, as some intrusion detection systems may ignore packets with high TTL values.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT**: The average throughput from the source to the destination is 832000, which is quite high. This could indicate a large amount of data being sent in a short amount of time, which is often associated with data exfiltration.

7. **TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS**: All these values are 0, which is unusual as TCP flags are typically used to establish and manage TCP connections. This could indicate the use of a non-standard or malicious TCP implementation.

8. **L4_DST_PORT: 520**: This is the port for the Routing Information Protocol (RIP), which is an old protocol with known vulnerabilities. It could be an attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities.

These suspicious feature values collectively suggest that the network flow could be associated with malicious activities.
