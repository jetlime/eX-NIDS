The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS (19)**: These flags indicate the TCP connection state. A value of 19 suggests that the SYN, FIN, and PSH flags are set, which is unusual. This could indicate a SYN/FIN scan, which is a type of stealth scanning technique used by attackers to bypass firewall rules and intrusion detection systems.

2. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, DURATION_OUT (0)**: These values indicate that the flow duration is zero, which is highly unusual. This could suggest a fast, automated process, such as a bot or malware, which is attempting to connect and disconnect rapidly to avoid detection.

3. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES (100), RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS (1)**: These values indicate that there has been retransmission of packets from the source to the destination. Retransmissions can occur due to network congestion, but they can also be a sign of malicious activity, such as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

4. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT (4416000), DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT (2688000)**: These high throughput values could indicate a large amount of data being transferred in a short amount of time, which could be a sign of data exfiltration or a DoS attack.

5. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT (16383)**: These maximum TCP window sizes are suspiciously high, which could indicate an attempt to overload the system or network.

6. **ICMP_TYPE (25600), ICMP_IPV4_TYPE (100)**: These values are outside the normal range for ICMP types, which could indicate an attempt to use ICMP for malicious purposes, such as a ping sweep or ICMP tunneling.

7. **NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES (18)**: This high number of small packets could be indicative of a scan or a DoS attack.

These suspicious feature values together suggest that the network traffic could be malicious. Further investigation would be needed to confirm this and determine the exact nature of the potential threat.
