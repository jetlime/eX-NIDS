The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 80**: This is the standard port for HTTP traffic. If the source IP is not a trusted one, it could be an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the HTTP server.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in many types of cyber attacks.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19**: These values indicate that some unusual TCP flags were set. In normal circumstances, not all flags are used at once. The use of multiple flags could indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability or perform a reconnaissance scan.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0**: These values indicate that the flow duration was extremely short, which is unusual and could suggest a scan or attack attempt.

5. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 222, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 2231, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 2**: These values indicate that there were retransmissions in both directions. This could suggest packet loss, which might be due to network congestion, but in the context of other suspicious indicators, it could also be a sign of malicious activity.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 6368000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 37744000**: The average throughput from the source to the destination and vice versa are quite high. This could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

7. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 16383, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383**: These values are the maximum window sizes for the TCP connection. A high window size can be used in TCP flood attacks.

8. **ICMP_TYPE: 56832, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 222**: These values are not standard ICMP types, which could indicate an attempt to use ICMP for malicious purposes, such as a ping sweep or a network scan.

These indicators collectively suggest that the network traffic could be malicious. However, further investigation would be needed to confirm this and identify the specific type of attack.
