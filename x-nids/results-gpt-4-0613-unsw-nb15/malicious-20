The NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 80**: This is the standard port for HTTP traffic. If the source IP is not a known web server, this could indicate an attempt to disguise malicious traffic as normal web browsing.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in many types of attacks.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19**: These values indicate that some unusual TCP flags were set. In normal circumstances, not all flags are used at once. The use of multiple flags could indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP protocol.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0**: These values indicate that the flow duration was extremely short. This could suggest a scan or a denial-of-service attack.

5. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 480, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 2, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 998, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 2**: These values indicate that there were retransmissions in both directions. This could suggest packet loss, which might be a sign of a network attack or a very poor network connection.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 11136000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 18656000**: These high throughput values could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a denial-of-service attack.

7. **NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 18, NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES: 2, NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES: 4, NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES: 2**: The distribution of packet sizes is unusual and could indicate an attempt to evade detection.

8. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 16383, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383**: These maximum TCP window sizes are unusually large, which could indicate an attempt to overload the target system or network.

9. **ICMP_TYPE: 57344, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 224**: These values are outside the normal range for ICMP types, which could indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the ICMP protocol.

These suspicious feature values together suggest that the network traffic could be part of a malicious activity such as a network scan, a denial-of-service attack, a data exfiltration attempt, or an attempt to exploit protocol vulnerabilities.
