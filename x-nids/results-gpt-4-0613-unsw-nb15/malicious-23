The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several reasons:

1. Destination Port (L4_DST_PORT): The destination port is 445, which is associated with the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This protocol is often targeted by malware and ransomware attacks, such as the WannaCry ransomware attack, because it allows for remote execution of commands.

2. TCP Flags (TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS): The TCP flags are set to 19, which corresponds to SYN, FIN flags being set. This is unusual because a TCP connection typically starts with a SYN flag and ends with a FIN flag. Having both flags set in the same packet could indicate a type of scan or attack, such as a stealth FIN scan.

3. Flow Duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, DURATION_OUT): The flow duration is 0 milliseconds. This is suspicious because it's not normal for a connection to start and end instantaneously.

4. Retransmitted Bytes and Packets (RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS): There are retransmitted bytes and packets in both directions. This could indicate packet loss or network congestion, but it could also be a sign of malicious activity, such as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or an attempt to overwhelm a system.

5. TTL Values (MIN_TTL, MAX_TTL): The TTL values are very high (254 and 255). This could be an attempt to ensure that the packets reach their destination, regardless of the number of hops they have to make. This is often seen in malicious traffic.

6. ICMP Type (ICMP_TYPE, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE): The ICMP type is 15616 and the ICMP IPv4 type is 61. These are not standard ICMP types and could indicate malicious activity.

7. High Throughput (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT): The average throughput is quite high, which could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a DoS attack.

8. Large Number of Small Packets (NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES): There are a large number of small packets. This could be a sign of a DoS attack or an attempt to evade detection by splitting malicious data into smaller packets. 

These features together make the NetFlow data suspicious and likely to be flagged as malicious by a Network Intrusion Detection System.
