The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **High TCP Flags**: The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS are all set to 19. This indicates that the SYN, FIN, and PSH flags are set, which is unusual for normal traffic. This could be an indication of a TCP scan or a TCP flood attack.

2. **Flow Duration**: The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, and DURATION_OUT are all set to 0. This is unusual as it indicates that the flow started and ended in the same millisecond, which is not typical for normal network traffic.

3. **Retransmitted Packets and Bytes**: The RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES, and RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS values are all non-zero. This suggests that there were issues with the transmission of packets, which could be due to network congestion, packet loss, or potentially malicious activity such as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

4. **High Throughput**: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT are quite high. This could indicate a large amount of data being transferred in a short amount of time, which could be a sign of data exfiltration or a DoS attack.

5. **TCP Window Size**: The TCP_WIN_MAX_IN and TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT are both set to the maximum value of 16383. This could indicate an attempt to overload the buffer, which could be a sign of a buffer overflow attack.

6. **ICMP Type**: The ICMP_TYPE is set to 52480, which is not a valid ICMP type. This could indicate an attempt to use a non-standard protocol to bypass security measures.

7. **High TTL Values**: The MIN_TTL and MAX_TTL are set to 254 and 255 respectively, which are the maximum possible values. This could indicate an attempt to prevent the packets from being dropped, which could be a sign of a DoS attack or an attempt to maintain a persistent connection for malicious purposes. 

These suspicious feature values suggest that the network traffic could be part of a malicious activity such as a network scan, a DoS attack, data exfiltration, or an attempt to exploit a vulnerability.
