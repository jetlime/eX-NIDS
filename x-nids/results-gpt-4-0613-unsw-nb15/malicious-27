The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious features:

1. High Volume of Data Transfer: The IN_BYTES (195184) and OUT_BYTES (2618) values are quite high, indicating a large amount of data being transferred. This could be a sign of data exfiltration, where an attacker is stealing sensitive information.

2. High Retransmission Rate: The RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES (97416) and RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS (78) are also high. This could be due to network congestion, but it could also be a sign of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, where an attacker floods the network with traffic to overwhelm it.

3. Unusual TCP Flags: The TCP_FLAGS (27), CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS (27), and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS (19) values are unusual. These flags control how TCP connections are established, maintained, and terminated. Unusual flag values could indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP protocol.

4. High Flow Duration: The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS (4294951) is quite high, indicating a long-lasting connection. This could be a sign of a persistent threat, where an attacker maintains a connection to a victim's network for an extended period.

5. Unusual Port Number: The L4_DST_PORT is 25, which is typically used for SMTP (email). If the network doesn't normally send a lot of email, this could be a sign of spamming or phishing activity.

6. High Throughput: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT (91848000) and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT (1232000) are quite high, indicating a lot of data being transferred quickly. This could be another sign of data exfiltration.

7. Unusual ICMP Type: The ICMP_TYPE (34817) and ICMP_IPV4_TYPE (136) are unusual. ICMP is used for error reporting and operational information in IP networks. Unusual ICMP types could indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the ICMP protocol.

These features together suggest that the network traffic is likely malicious.
