The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 21** - This is the port number for FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which is often used by attackers to upload malicious files or exfiltrate data.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6** - This is the protocol number for TCP, which is commonly used in many types of attacks.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 16, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 16, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 16** - These flags indicate that only the ACK (Acknowledgement) flag is set. This is unusual because typically, TCP connections start with SYN flags and end with FIN or RST flags. A connection with only ACK flags could indicate a half-open connection or a stealth scan, both of which are common in network attacks.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0** - These values indicate that the flow duration was extremely short, which is unusual and could suggest an automated process or a scan.

5. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 98, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 2, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 187, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 2** - These values indicate that some packets were retransmitted, which could suggest packet loss or network congestion. However, in the context of the other suspicious feature values, it could also suggest malicious activity, such as a denial-of-service attack or an attempt to evade intrusion detection systems.

6. **FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE: 227.0** - This is the FTP response code for "Entering Passive Mode", which is often used in FTP bounce attacks. In such attacks, the attacker exploits the FTP protocol's feature to request that a file be sent to a third-party server, which can be used to scan the server's ports or to launch a denial-of-service attack.

These suspicious feature values, taken together, strongly suggest that the NetFlow data is associated with malicious activity.
