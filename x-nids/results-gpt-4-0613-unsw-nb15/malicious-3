The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **Flow Duration:** The flow duration is 0 milliseconds, which is highly unusual. This could indicate a scanning activity or a DoS (Denial of Service) attack where the attacker is trying to overwhelm the target system with a large number of requests in a very short time.

2. **TCP Flags:** The TCP flags value is 19, which corresponds to SYN, FIN flags being set. This is an abnormal combination because the SYN flag is used to initiate a TCP connection, while the FIN flag is used to close a connection. Having both flags set in the same packet is a common characteristic of certain types of network scanning or attacks, such as a stealth (FIN) scan.

3. **Retransmitted Out Bytes/Packets:** There's a retransmitted outbound packet with 338 bytes. Retransmissions can occur due to network congestion, but they can also be a sign of malicious activity, such as a reflection attack.

4. **TCP Window Size:** The maximum TCP window size for both inbound and outbound is 16383, which is the maximum possible value. This could indicate an attempt to perform a TCP Window Size DoS attack, where the attacker tries to consume the target's resources by sending packets with the maximum window size.

5. **Throughput:** The average throughput from source to destination is 2816000, and from destination to source is 7456000. This high throughput could be a sign of a data exfiltration attempt or a flooding attack.

6. **Packet Sizes:** The majority of packets are up to 128 bytes, with two packets between 256 and 512 bytes. Small packet sizes can be a sign of a scanning activity or a DoS attack.

7. **L7 Protocol:** The Layer 7 protocol is 0.0, which is unusual as this should typically correspond to an application protocol like HTTP, FTP, etc. This could indicate that the traffic is obfuscated or encrypted, which is common in malicious activities.

These are just some of the suspicious feature values. A thorough investigation would require more context and possibly additional data.
