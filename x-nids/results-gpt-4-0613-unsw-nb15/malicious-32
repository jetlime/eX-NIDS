The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS (19)**: These values indicate that the SYN, FIN, and RST flags are set. This is unusual because SYN is used to initiate a TCP connection, while FIN and RST are used to terminate it. Having all these flags set in the same packet is a common characteristic of certain types of network attacks, such as port scanning or denial-of-service attacks.

2. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, DURATION_OUT (0)**: These values indicate that the flow duration is zero, which is highly unusual. This could suggest a fast, automated process, such as a bot or a script, which is often associated with malicious activities.

3. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES (169), RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS (2), RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES (85), RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS (1)**: These values indicate that there are retransmitted packets in both directions. This could be a sign of poor network conditions, but it could also suggest an attempt to overwhelm the network or evade detection, which is a common tactic in network attacks.

4. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT (5520000), DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT (3408000)**: These high throughput values could suggest a large amount of data being transferred in a short period of time, which could be a sign of a data exfiltration attempt.

5. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT (16383)**: These maximum TCP window sizes are unusually large, which could be an attempt to overwhelm the network or evade detection.

6. **ICMP_TYPE (43264), ICMP_IPV4_TYPE (169)**: These values are outside the normal range for ICMP types (0-255), which could suggest an attempt to use a covert channel or evade detection.

In conclusion, the combination of these suspicious feature values suggests that the network traffic represented by this NetFlow data is likely to be malicious.
