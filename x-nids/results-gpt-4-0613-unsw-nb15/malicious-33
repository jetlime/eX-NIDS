The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 8080**: This port is often used for proxy and caching, and can be a target for attacks if not properly secured.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in many types of cyber attacks due to its connection-oriented nature.

3. **IN_BYTES: 1984 and OUT_BYTES: 256**: The significant difference between the incoming and outgoing bytes suggests a data exfiltration attempt, where a large amount of data is being sent from the source to the destination.

4. **TCP_FLAGS: 19, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 19, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19**: The TCP flags indicate that the SYN, FIN, and PSH flags are set. This is unusual because SYN and FIN flags are not typically set in the same TCP segment unless it's part of an attack, such as a stealth scan or a TCP hijacking attempt.

5. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0**: These values suggest that the flow duration was extremely short, which is often a characteristic of automated attacks.

6. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 816, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 1**: The presence of retransmitted packets could indicate a network issue, but it could also be a sign of malicious activity, such as a denial of service attack or an attempt to overwhelm the system.

7. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 15872000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 2048000**: The significant difference in average throughput from source to destination and from destination to source further supports the possibility of data exfiltration.

8. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 16383, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383**: The maximum TCP window size is set to the highest possible value, which could be an attempt to maximize data transfer in a short amount of time, consistent with a data exfiltration attempt.

These suspicious feature values together suggest that the network traffic could be part of a malicious activity, such as a data exfiltration attempt or a denial of service attack.
