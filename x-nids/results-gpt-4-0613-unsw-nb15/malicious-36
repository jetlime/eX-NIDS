The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 25**: This is the port used for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), which is commonly exploited for sending spam or phishing emails. 

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is often used in various types of attacks, such as SYN flood attacks.

3. **IN_BYTES: 16980, OUT_BYTES: 1842**: The large difference between the incoming and outgoing bytes could indicate a data exfiltration attempt, where a large amount of data is being sent from the target to the attacker.

4. **TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19**: These flags indicate unusual TCP behavior. The combination of flags can indicate different types of attacks. For example, a SYN flag (2) combined with a FIN flag (1) is often used in stealth port scanning.

5. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0**: These values indicate that the flow duration is extremely short, which is unusual and could indicate malicious activity.

6. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 8314, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 12, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 793, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 7**: High retransmission rates could indicate a network scanning or DoS attack.

7. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 135840000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 14736000**: The significant difference in average throughput from source to destination and vice versa could indicate a data exfiltration attempt.

8. **ICMP_TYPE: 31232, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 122**: These values are outside the normal range for ICMP types (0-255), which could indicate an attempt to exploit the ICMP protocol.

These suspicious feature values collectively suggest that the network traffic could be malicious. However, further investigation would be needed to confirm the nature of the activity.
