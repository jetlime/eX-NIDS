The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **High Retransmission Rate**: The retransmitted_in_bytes and retransmitted_out_bytes are 285 and 144 respectively, and retransmitted_in_pkts and retransmitted_out_pkts are 4 and 2 respectively. This high retransmission rate indicates potential network issues or malicious activities such as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

2. **TCP Flags**: The TCP_FLAGS, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS, and SERVER_TCP_FLAGS are all set to 19. This value indicates that the SYN, FIN, and ACK flags are all set, which is unusual. This could be an indication of a SYN/FIN scanning attack, where a malicious actor is trying to bypass firewall rules.

3. **Flow Duration**: The FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, and DURATION_OUT are all 0. This means the flow was very short, which is unusual and could indicate a scan or probe.

4. **TTL Values**: The MIN_TTL and MAX_TTL values are 254 and 255 respectively. These are the maximum possible values, which is unusual and could indicate an attempt to avoid TTL-based intrusion detection systems.

5. **Port Numbers**: The L4_SRC_PORT is a high, ephemeral port number, while the L4_DST_PORT is 179, which is the well-known port for BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). This could indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the BGP service.

6. **Protocol and L7 Protocol**: The PROTOCOL is set to 6 (TCP), but the L7_PROTO is set to 0.0, which is unusual and could indicate an attempt to use a protocol in a way it's not intended to be used.

7. **Throughput**: The SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT and DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT are quite high, which could indicate a large amount of data being transferred in a short amount of time, potentially as part of a data exfiltration attempt.

8. **Packet Sizes**: The NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES is 28, while all other packet size categories have 0 packets. This could indicate a large number of small packets being sent, which is often associated with malicious activities like DoS attacks or scans.

These are just some of the suspicious feature values in the NetFlow data. A thorough investigation would require more context and potentially additional data.
