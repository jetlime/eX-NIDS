The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 25**: This is the port typically used for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). SMTP is often targeted by attackers for sending spam or phishing emails.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in many types of attacks due to its connection-oriented nature.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19**: These flags indicate unusual TCP behavior. A normal TCP connection starts with a SYN flag (2), followed by a SYN-ACK flag (18), and ends with an ACK flag (16). The presence of additional flags, such as URG (32) or PSH (8), could indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP protocol.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0**: These values indicate that the flow duration was extremely short, which is unusual and could suggest an automated attack.

5. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 1167, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 6, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 669, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 7**: These high retransmission rates could indicate network congestion, packet loss, or a possible Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 21488000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 13392000**: These high throughput values could indicate a large amount of data being transferred in a short amount of time, which is often a sign of data exfiltration or a DoS attack.

7. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 16383, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383**: These maximum TCP window sizes are unusually large, which could indicate an attempt to overload the network or bypass network security measures.

8. **ICMP_TYPE: 36608, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 143**: These unusual ICMP types could indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the ICMP protocol, such as ICMP tunneling or a Ping of Death attack.

In conclusion, the combination of these suspicious feature values suggests that this NetFlow data could be associated with a variety of malicious activities, including spamming, phishing, exploitation of TCP or ICMP vulnerabilities, DoS attacks, data exfiltration, and attempts to bypass network security measures.
