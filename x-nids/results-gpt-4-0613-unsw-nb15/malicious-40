The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 25**: This is the port used for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), which is commonly exploited for sending spam or phishing emails. 

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is often used in various types of attacks, such as SYN flood attacks.

3. **IN_BYTES: 23866, OUT_BYTES: 1756**: The large discrepancy between the incoming and outgoing bytes could suggest a data exfiltration attempt.

4. **TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19**: These values indicate abnormal TCP flag settings, which could suggest malicious activities like port scanning or DoS attacks.

5. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0**: These zero values suggest that the flow duration is extremely short, which is unusual and could indicate a scanning activity or a DoS attack.

6. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 11757, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 14, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 710, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 7**: High retransmission rates could indicate network congestion, but they could also be a sign of malicious activities like TCP retransmission attacks.

7. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 190928000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 14048000**: The significant difference in average throughput could suggest a data exfiltration attempt.

8. **NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 40, NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES: 2, NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES: 0, NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES: 2, NUM_PKTS_1024_TO_1514_BYTES: 14**: The distribution of packet sizes is unusual, which could indicate an attempt to avoid detection by varying the packet sizes.

9. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 16383, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383**: These maximum TCP window sizes are unusually large, which could suggest a TCP window size attack.

10. **ICMP_TYPE: 60672, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 237**: These unusual ICMP types could suggest an ICMP tunneling attempt, which is a method used to bypass firewalls.

These suspicious feature values collectively suggest that the network traffic is likely to be malicious.
