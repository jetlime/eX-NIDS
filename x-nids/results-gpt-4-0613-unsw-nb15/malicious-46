The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 80**: This is the default port for HTTP traffic. Malicious actors often use this port to blend in with normal web traffic.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This indicates the TCP protocol, which is commonly used in many types of attacks.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19**: These values indicate unusual TCP flag settings. Normal TCP connections usually have different flag values for client and server, and the values here suggest potential TCP flag manipulation, which is a common technique in various attacks.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0**: These values indicate that the flow duration is zero, which is highly unusual and could suggest a fast, automated attack.

5. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 905, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 2, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 1505, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 2**: These high retransmission rates could indicate a network scan or a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

6. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 17296000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 26128000**: These high throughput values could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a DoS attack.

7. **NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 14, NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES: 6, NUM_PKTS_1024_TO_1514_BYTES: 2**: The distribution of packet sizes is unusual and could suggest malicious activity such as a network scan or a DoS attack.

8. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 16383, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383**: These maximum TCP window sizes are unusually high, which could indicate a TCP Window Size DoS attack.

9. **ICMP_TYPE: 35072, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 137**: These ICMP types are unusual and could indicate an ICMP tunneling attack, which is a method of data exfiltration.

These suspicious feature values together suggest that the network traffic could be malicious. Further investigation is needed to confirm the nature of the activity.
