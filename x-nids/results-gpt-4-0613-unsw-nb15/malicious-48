The NetFlow data is flagged as malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 21**: This is the port for FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which is often used for data exfiltration or command and control communication by malware.

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This represents TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which is commonly used by malware for establishing a connection.

3. **TCP_FLAGS: 16, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 16, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 0**: The TCP flags indicate the type of control signals used in the TCP connection. A value of 16 corresponds to the ACK (Acknowledgement) flag. The fact that the client is only sending ACK flags and the server is not responding with any flags is suspicious, as it indicates a one-sided communication which is not typical for normal TCP connections.

4. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0**: These values indicate that the flow duration is extremely short, which is unusual for a typical FTP session. This could suggest an automated process, such as a bot or malware, is involved.

5. **MIN_TTL: 254, MAX_TTL: 255**: The Time to Live (TTL) values are very high, which is unusual and could indicate an attempt to bypass network security measures.

6. **FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE: 331**: This FTP return code indicates a request for a password, which could suggest an attempt to brute force or otherwise compromise an FTP server.

7. **IN_BYTES: 9, OUT_BYTES: 74**: The discrepancy between the inbound and outbound bytes could indicate data exfiltration.

8. **TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383**: This is the maximum window size for outbound TCP, which is unusually high and could indicate an attempt to overload the server or network.

These features collectively suggest that the flagged NetFlow data is associated with malicious activity, likely involving an attempt to compromise an FTP server, possibly for data exfiltration or command and control communication.
