The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. L4_DST_PORT: The destination port is 21, which is typically used for FTP (File Transfer Protocol). FTP is often targeted by attackers for data exfiltration or to deliver malicious payloads.

2. PROTOCOL: The protocol used is 6, which corresponds to TCP. TCP is often used in attacks due to its reliable data delivery.

3. TCP_FLAGS and CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: Both are set to 24, which corresponds to PA (Push Acknowledge) in TCP flag terms. This could indicate an attempt to push through data without waiting for an acknowledgment, which is a common tactic in various types of attacks.

4. SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: The server TCP flags are set to 0, which could indicate that the server is not responding as expected, possibly due to an ongoing attack.

5. FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS, DURATION_IN, and DURATION_OUT: All these values are 0, which is unusual. It could indicate a very short-lived connection, possibly used for a quick data transfer or command execution.

6. IN_BYTES and OUT_BYTES: The number of incoming bytes is significantly less than the number of outgoing bytes. This could indicate data exfiltration.

7. TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: The maximum TCP window size for outgoing packets is set to its maximum value (16383), which could indicate an attempt to maximize data transfer rate for exfiltration or payload delivery.

8. FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE: The FTP command return code is 331, which indicates a request for a password. This could be part of an attempt to gain unauthorized access.

These suspicious feature values together suggest that the flagged NetFlow data could be part of a malicious activity, such as an attempt to exfiltrate data, deliver a malicious payload, or gain unauthorized access.
