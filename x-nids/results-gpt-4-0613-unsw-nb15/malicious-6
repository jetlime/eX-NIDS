The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. High Source Port (L4_SRC_PORT: 65453): The source port is unusually high. Ports above 49152 are typically used for ephemeral purposes and are not associated with well-known services. This could indicate that a non-standard application, potentially malicious, is being used.

2. TCP Flags (TCP_FLAGS: 19, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 19, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19): The TCP flags indicate that SYN, FIN, and RST flags are set, which is unusual. This could suggest an attempt to perform a TCP flag-based attack, such as a SYN flood or a FIN scan.

3. Flow Duration (FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 4294935): The flow duration is quite long, which could indicate a slow data exfiltration attempt or a long-term connection to a command and control server.

4. Retransmitted Out Bytes (RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 687): The presence of retransmitted bytes in the outbound direction could indicate network issues, but it could also suggest an attempt to evade detection by splitting the malicious payload across multiple packets.

5. High Throughput (SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 80000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 392000): The high average throughput could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a DoS attack.

6. Maximum TCP Window Size (TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 16383, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383): The maximum TCP window size is set to its upper limit, which could indicate an attempt to maximize data transfer, potentially for exfiltration or flooding purposes.

7. Number of Packets (NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES: 14, NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES: 2): The number of small packets could indicate a scan or reconnaissance activity, while the number of larger packets could suggest data exfiltration.

These features together suggest that the network traffic could be associated with malicious activity such as a scan, DoS attack, or data exfiltration.
