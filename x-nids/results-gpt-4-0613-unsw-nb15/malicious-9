The NetFlow data is considered malicious due to several suspicious feature values:

1. **L4_DST_PORT: 25**: This is the port used for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), which is commonly exploited for sending spam or phishing emails. 

2. **PROTOCOL: 6**: This represents TCP, which is often used in various types of attacks due to its connection-oriented nature.

3. **IN_BYTES: 65828, OUT_BYTES: 2110**: The significant difference between the incoming and outgoing bytes suggests that the source IP is sending a large amount of data to the destination IP, which could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a DoS attack.

4. **TCP_FLAGS: 27, CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS: 27, SERVER_TCP_FLAGS: 19**: These values indicate that some unusual TCP flags are set. For example, a TCP flag value of 27 corresponds to the combination of SYN, ACK, and FIN flags, which is unusual and could indicate a TCP/IP-based attack such as a SYN flood or a FIN scan.

5. **FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS: 0, DURATION_IN: 0, DURATION_OUT: 0**: These values suggest that the flow duration is extremely short, which is often associated with automated attacks or scans.

6. **RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES: 32738, RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS: 29, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES: 807, RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS: 7**: The high number of retransmitted packets and bytes could indicate a poor connection, but it could also be a sign of a network attack, such as a TCP retransmission attack.

7. **SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 526624000, DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT: 16880000**: The average throughput from the source to the destination is significantly higher than the throughput from the destination to the source, which could indicate a data exfiltration attempt or a DoS attack.

8. **TCP_WIN_MAX_IN: 16383, TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT: 16383**: These values are the maximum, indicating that the TCP window size is being fully utilized, which could be a sign of a network performance issue or a potential network attack.

9. **ICMP_TYPE: 57856, ICMP_IPV4_TYPE: 226**: These are non-standard ICMP types, which could indicate an attempt to use ICMP for malicious purposes, such as a ping flood attack or an ICMP tunneling attack.

In conclusion, the combination of these suspicious feature values suggests that the network traffic represented by this NetFlow data is likely to be malicious.
